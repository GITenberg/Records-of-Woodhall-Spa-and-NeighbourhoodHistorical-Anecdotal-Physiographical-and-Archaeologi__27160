3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>The series of &ldquo;Records&rdquo; of various kinds which
will be found in the following chapters are drawn from personal
reminiscences, extending over more than half a century, combined
with notes collected from many different sources during at least
two-thirds of that period.&nbsp; In dealing with such material
one is apt, even unconsciously, to be egotistical, and to linger
too long and too fondly over scenes and incidents of which one
might say, in Virgilian phrase, <i>quorum pars</i>, <i>si non
magna</i>, <i>at parva fui</i>.&nbsp; Should the reader deem any
portions unduly prolix, he will, perhaps, kindly excuse it on
this score.&nbsp; But I have known several instances, and
especially of late two in this neighbourhood, when a person
advanced in years and of wide experience, has passed away, and
there has been a general, and doubtless sincere, regret that he
has gone, and all his store of accumulated information gone with
him.</p>
<p>Circumstances have given me such opportunities&mdash;and
enjoyed so long&mdash;of acquiring a knowledge of Woodhall Spa,
and of most matters connected with it, that I am probably stating
only the unvarnished truth, when I say that no one else living
could bring together the varied details, however inadequately
treated, which will here be found.&nbsp; Some of them may seem of
small importance in the eyes of many&mdash;&ldquo;caviare to the
general&rdquo;&mdash;but I have thought it better that even these
minor details should not be consigned to the limbo of the
forgotten, because unrecorded.</p>
<p>I have approached the subject from different points of
view&mdash;historical, anecdotal, naturalist, and
arch&aelig;ological, so as to cater for the different tastes of
readers.</p>
<p>Inheriting an interest in Woodhall Spa, hallowed by cherished
associations, my aim has been so to unfold its many attractions,
even in beast, bird, and flower, as to communicate an interest in
it to others as well.</p>
<p>In publishing a third issue of these Records, I am bound in
duty to thank a wide circle of readers for the interest so far
taken in the <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>work.&nbsp; I had now hoped to give it
a more attractive form, but the low price at which a guide-book
must be sold, in order to bring it within the reach of a general
public, precludes a more expensive &ldquo;get-up&rdquo; of the
volume.&nbsp; The only change, therefore, has been that the
edition is brought &ldquo;up to date&rdquo; by a few necessary
corrections and additions.&nbsp; To future readers I would only
say, in Ovidian phrase:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Si qua meo fuerint, ut erunt, vitiosa libello,<br
/>
Excusata, precor, Lector amicus, habe.</p>

5</span>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; THE HISTORY OF THE WELL.</h2>
<p>It has been remarked that the discovery of many of our
medicinal springs has been due to some romantic incident, or, in
other cases, to some occurrence partaking almost of the
ludicrous.&nbsp; At the famed Carlsbad, for instance, a princely
hunter pursues his stag into the lake where it has sought refuge,
whereupon the unusual cries of his hounds, too eagerly breasting
the waters, speedily reveal to him the strongly thermal nature of
the spring which feeds the lake, and the discovery has benefited
the thousands who annually frequent that health-giving resort
from almost every land.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the case of
our own Bath, although well known to the ancient Romans&mdash;as
also in the later case of Bolsover&mdash;tradition avers that an
unhealthy pig, instinctively &ldquo;wallowing in the mire&rdquo;
produced by the oozing spring, and emerging from the uncleanly
bath cured of its ailment, was the humble instrument to
demonstrate the health-restoring power of the water, to the
subsequent advantage of suffering humanity.&nbsp; Other cases,
more or less legendary, might be adduced; let these suffice.</p>
<p>The discovery, however, of the Woodhall water, if leas
romantic, is no myth, shrouded in the mystery of a distant past,
since it has the advantage of being, comparatively, of so recent
a date, that the historian can consult the contemporary testimony
of eyewitnesses still living, or of those to whom others have
related the particulars from their own personal knowledge.&nbsp;
The following account has been thus collected, and put into
connected form:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the early years of this 19th century there lived a certain
John Parkinson, Esquire, a scion of a family of position and
wealth in the county, who owned, with other property, the estate
of Woodhall. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; Being of a speculative and
enterprising bent of mind, it is said that he became enamoured of
three ideas or projects, which he thought he had the means and
opportunity of carrying out.&nbsp; One of these was to sink a
coal mine, a second was to plant a forest, and a third was to
build a city.&nbsp; For the last purpose he purchased from the
Crown a tract of fenland, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>situated between Revesby and Boston,
being an outlying allotment of the original ancient parish of
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Here be built (about 1816) a street of houses,
which he named New Bolingbroke.&nbsp; The speculation, however,
proved a failure, probably owing to the loneliness of the
position; and it was not till several years later, when the
property had passed into the possession of J. Banks Stanhope,
Esq., of Revesby Abbey, who spent much money on needed
improvements, that the new &ldquo;city&rdquo; became a fairly
populous village, as it is at the present time.</p>
<p>Mr. Parkinson&rsquo;s second project was the planting of a
forest.&nbsp; For this purpose he secured a large tract of waste
moorland, in the parishes of Roughton and Kirkby, lying to the
south of the present road to Horncastle, and within some two
miles eastward of Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; This land he planted
extensively with fir and oak, and in course of time they became a
dense wood.&nbsp; This growth has since then been largely
destroyed by fire, or has yielded to the woodman&rsquo;s axe, and
at the present time there are left not more than forty acres of
the original &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; the rest being chiefly open
moor, the whole going by the name of &ldquo;Ostler&rsquo;s
Plantations,&rdquo; Mr. Ostler being the agent employed in the
work and becoming himself (as will be seen) eventually the
proprietor.&nbsp; Thus of two eggs which Mr. Parkinson brooded
over, and desired to hatch, one may be said to have been addled,
and the other did not prove useful to himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The best laid plans of mice and men<br />
Gang aft agley.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now come to the third &ldquo;incubation,&rdquo; which has,
it may fairly be said, proved (though once more, not to himself)
a &ldquo;golden egg.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been observed that he
had conceived the idea of searching for coal.&nbsp; For this
purpose he selected a spot which has since become the site of the
Woodhall well.&nbsp; It is said that he was guided in this by the
advice of a Mr. J. Clarkson, residing at that time at Moorby, not
far from his residence at Bolingbroke, and who had had some
previous experience among the Yorkshire coal mines.&nbsp; The
boring was begun in the year 1811, and was carried on under the
supervision of Mr. Clarkson.&nbsp; When the shaft had reached a
depth of about 540ft., there occurred an inrush of clear, salt
water, which compelled the excavators to retreat.&nbsp; The work
was, however, afterwards resumed, a brick conduit for the water
being constructed, and so, <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>at the cost of
great labour, and by shifts of men working day and night, without
intermission, a depth of over 1,000ft. was attained.&nbsp; It is
said (we know not with what truth) that Mr. Parkinson and his
agent were induced to go on with the boring to this extent,
because the men brought up in their pockets fragments of coal
(which they had of course themselves taken down), and the hopes
of success were thus buoyed up.&nbsp; When, however, this depth
of 1,000ft. had been attained, and no vein of coal discovered,
the unfortunate proprietor was compelled, from lack of funds, to
abandon the enterprise.&nbsp; The boring to such a depth was, of
course, a work extending over a lengthy period, and the
occasional exhibition of these fragments of coal by the labourers
led to false reports of success being periodically
circulated.&nbsp; It is said that there were frequent scenes of
great excitement at Mr. Parkinson&rsquo;s residence; persons of
all classes, even the poor, flocking thither to lend their money
to him on the bare security of his notes of hand, hoping
themselves to derive a large profit from the expected mine.&nbsp;
On one occasion the bells of Horncastle Parish Church were rung
in the night, announcing the joyful tidings that coal had been
found.&nbsp; But, alas! all these hopes were illusory.&nbsp; Mr.
Parkinson himself became a ruined man, and many a poor investor
lost his all, sunk in the mine.&nbsp; The attempt thus proving
abortive, the mine was closed, and remained so for several years,
Mr. Parkinson himself disappearing from the scene, and his
Woodhall property passing into other hands&mdash;the ancestors of
the present owners of the estate.&nbsp; As the result of this
collapse, other portions of Mr. Parkinson&rsquo;s property in the
neighbourhood also changed hands.&nbsp; Mr. Ostler, who has been
already mentioned, had advanced to him large sums of money, and
in lieu of repayment he acquired the &ldquo;Forest,&rdquo; since
in consequence (as I have said) called &ldquo;the Ostler
Plantations,&rdquo; and which still remains the property of his
representatives.</p>
<p>During the making of the shaft a serious accident
occurred.&nbsp; Two men were below in the shaft working at the
bore, a man being at the top to hoist them, by machinery, to the
surface, to be out of danger whenever, in the process of boring,
an explosion was about to take place.&nbsp; They had arranged
their explosive for a blast, had lighted the fuse, and then gave
the signal to be hoisted up; but the man at the mouth of the mine
had gone to sleep, their signal was disregarded, and they were
left unable to help <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>themselves.&nbsp; The explosion took
place; one of them, William East by name, was killed, and his
body much mangled; the other man, Tyler, was seriously injured,
but escaped with his life. <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a></p>
<p>A poem was written on the occasion by Mr. John Sharpe, of
Kirkstead, <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> which I here give.&nbsp; The rural muse
was somewhat unclassical in those days, and versions vary, but it
was in the main as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was early one morning, the 15th of June,<br />
I was called from my bed by a sorrowful tune;<br />
With sad lamentations a mother appeared,<br />
And sad were the tidings I then from her heard. <a
name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a><br />
&ldquo;Our William,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has been killed in
the pit;<br />
Another is injured, but not dead yet.<br />
By firing some powder to blow up the stone,<br />
Poor William was killed, and he died with a groan.&rdquo;<br />
I put on my clothes, and I hastened away.<br />
Till I came to the place where poor William lay.<br />
He lay on some sacks all covered with gore:<br />
A sight so distressing, I ne&rsquo;er saw before.<br />
I inwardly thought, as his wounds were laid bare.<br />
How many before had been slain in the war. <a
name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a><br />
In a moment of time he was summoned away;<br />
How needful that we, too, should watch and should pray.<br />
The Lord help us all through our hopes and our fears,<br />
To live to his praise all our days and years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pit, once closed, remained so for some years, and there
seemed no prospect of anything but loss accruing from the
undertaking.&nbsp; But meanwhile, as time passed on,
&ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; was in labour.&nbsp; The water in the
shaft gradually accumulated, eventually reaching the surface, and
then overflowed, running down an adjoining ditch, which skirted
what is now called &ldquo;Coal-pit Wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
overflow naturally attracted attention.&nbsp; Such things as
&ldquo;Spas&rdquo; were not unknown.&nbsp; There was one at
Lincoln, not far from the present Arboretum, and the Woodhall
water being found to be <i>salt</i>, as was said, like sea water,
several persons tried it for different purposes.&nbsp; A very old
man (living, in 1899, at <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Kirkby-on-Bain) <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> states that he and several others in
that parish used the water as a purgative (a property which it
still retains).&nbsp; Others used it as increasing the appetite
(one of the effects still remarked).&nbsp; Joseph East, lately
resident at Kirkstead, and brother of the man killed in the pit,
was sent, as a boy, to get a bottle of it to administer to a sick
horse.&nbsp; The Squire, Mr. T. Hotchkin, found it very
beneficial for his gout, and the servant, who brought the water
for him, mentioned this to a woman at Horsington, named Coo,
suffering from rheumatism.&nbsp; By the advice of her doctor, she
tried the water, and was completely cured.&nbsp; In October,
1903, died Mrs. Wilson, mother of Robert Wilson, gardener, of
Martin Dales, aged 92.&nbsp; She was the oldest patient then
living who had baths at Woodhall before the first bath-house was
built.&nbsp; There was only a wooden bath, at a charge of 1s. per
bath.&nbsp; Many similar <a name="citation9b"></a><a
href="#footnote9b" class="citation">[9b]</a> cases are recorded
by the older inhabitants, which proved beyond doubt the efficacy
of the water in the ailments of man and beast, especially for
rheumatism and skin diseases.</p>
<p>This led to the re-opening of the mine shaft about the year
1824.&nbsp; In 1829, or 1830, a small protecting structure was
erected, a windlass was put up, which was worked by a horse
walking round and round, drawing the water from &ldquo;the
well,&rdquo; as it came now to be termed, and an open brick tank
was constructed in which the poor could dip, a veritable modern
Siloam. <a name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a></p>
<p>In 1834 a bath house was erected by the late Thomas Hotchkin,
Esq., the then owner of Woodhall, and in the following year the
Victoria Hotel was built by him, his whole outlay amounting to
some &pound;30,000.&nbsp; Provision was thus made for the
reception of visitors, and the treatment of their ailments on a
scale more than adequate for the public requirements at the
time.&nbsp; Dr. Barton, Dr. Scott, and other medical
practitioners successively resided at the Spa, but for some years
longer (as will be shewn in <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the next
chapter) the difficulty of access prevented any great influx of
patients, such as we have seen in more recent times, and a
primitive state of things still prevailed, such as in these days
can be hardly realised, and Woodhall Spa was probably for some
years little known beyond the neighbourhood, or the county.</p>
<p>About sixty years ago a second well (remembered only as little
more than a floating, vague tradition) was sunk on other
property, not far from the present Mill-lane, near Kirkstead
Station.&nbsp; A solitary survivor of the workmen engaged in
sinking it died in 1897, well known to the writer.&nbsp; This
well was subsequently filled in again, the water being (as was
said) too <i>salt</i> for use.&nbsp; It is more probable that the
water tasted strongly of iron, as the local water, found within a
few feet of the surface, is generally impregnated with this
ingredient, so much so, that it commonly &ldquo;ferrs&rdquo;
water bottles if allowed to stand any time in them, this being
the effect of its ferruginous properties.</p>
<p>An account of the well would hardly be complete without some
particulars, so far as they can be obtained, of the geological
strata which were pierced by the shaft.&nbsp; These are said to
have been gravel and boulder clay, Kimmeridge and Oxford clays,
Kelloway&rsquo;s rock, blue clay, cornbrash, limestone, great
oolite, clay and limestone, upper Estuarine clay, Lincolnshire
oolite, and Northampton sands, Lias, upper, middle, and part of
lower.</p>
<p>Of the chemical ingredients of the water, as several accounts
have been given by different authorities, it is sufficient to say
here that its two most important elements are the iodine and
bromine, in both of which it far exceeds any other Spa.&nbsp; The
only known water which contains a greater proportion of bromine
is that of the Dead Sea, in Palestine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; LOCAL RECORDS OP THE PAST.</h2>
<p>To those who visit Woodhall Spa, in its present advanced and
advancing condition, it must be difficult to conceive the very
different condition of the locality even in the middle of the
19th century.&nbsp; If the Victorian era has been a period of
remarkable progress, nowhere has it been more so than at Woodhall
Spa.&nbsp; The place was, in those days, only accessible with
great difficulty.&nbsp; The roads, scarcely indeed worthy of the
name, were so bad that the writer well <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>remembers
going there, as a boy, with his father, for the first time, when
the ruts were so deep that the pony carriage, a four-wheeled
vehicle, broke in the middle, and had to be abandoned by the
roadside, and they had to return home to Langton, distant about
five miles, on foot.&nbsp; The road (now the Horncastle-road, and
in excellent condition) passed, for a mile or more, over a tract
of sandy moorland, and when the ruts became too deep for traffic
on one track, another was adopted, and that, in turn, was
abandoned when it became impassable.&nbsp; It was indeed a
veritable Sahara on a small scale.&nbsp; The road to Tattershall
was fairly good, having probably been an old Roman highway. <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Such roads are locally called
&ldquo;rampers,&rdquo; i.e., ramparts.&nbsp; The road to
&ldquo;Kirkstead Wharf,&rdquo; or ferry, where now a fine bridge
spans the river Witham, was also in fairly good condition. <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; The road which now runs from St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church by the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop and
Reed&rsquo;s Beck to Old Woodhall and Langton was just passable
with difficulty.&nbsp; A small steam packet plied on the river
Witham, between Boston and Lincoln, calling at Kirkstead twice a
day, going and returning, and a carrier&rsquo;s cart from
Horncastle struggled through the sand once a day, each way, in
connection with it. <a name="citation11c"></a><a
href="#footnote11c" class="citation">[11c]</a>&nbsp; The
condition of the road remained but little altered till shortly
before the opening of the &ldquo;loop line&rdquo; of railway <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>between Boston and Lincoln in 1848.&nbsp; In preparation
for this event the Horncastle-road was put into a fairly good
state of repair.&nbsp; In connection with the railway two rival
coaches were run from the Bull and George Hotels at Horncastle,
calling at Woodhall Spa, en route to Kirkstead Station.&nbsp; As
yet, however, the traffic was lacking to make the enterprise
remunerative.&nbsp; The brace of coaches were then merged in one,
but, for the same reason, that arrangement was presently
abandoned, and for some years there remained only the
carrier&rsquo;s cart, slightly accelerated in speed, and even
that was sometimes precarious in its journeys.&nbsp; The writer
has found it necessary, on arriving at Kirkstead Station on a
dark night, to shoulder his own portmanteau and carry it himself,
for lack of other means of transport, from Kirkstead to Langton,
a distance of six miles. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; At length, in
1855, the line between Kirkstead and Horncastle, with a station
at Woodhall Spa, was opened, which has proved to be one of the
most paying amongst railway ventures in the kingdom, and has
opened up communication between Woodhall Spa and all parts of the
country.&nbsp; From these particulars it will be seen that,
although the whilom owner of the Woodhall Estate (Mr. Thos.
Hotchkin) had spent large sums of money (some &pound;30,000 it
was said) in building the bathhouse and hotel in 1834&ndash;5,
yet the establishment for several years laboured under great
disadvantages owing to its difficulty of access.&nbsp; Indeed,
persons wishing to visit the Spa from a distance had, for the
most part, to bring their own carriages; or, if arriving by the
ordinary means of transit, and wishing to move beyond the
immediate precincts of the hotel, they had to hire a conveyance
from the Victoria Hotel, where the supply was very limited.&nbsp;
Moreover, in those days some of the lighter kinds of carriage now
in vogue, such as the modern dog-cart, were unknown.&nbsp; The
chaise and the gig, large or small, were the conveyances in
common use, the days not being yet past when the farmer&rsquo;s
wife rode to market on a pillion behind her husband.</p>
<p>In matters spiritual there was also a corresponding
backwardness.&nbsp; The nominal district <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of Woodhall
Spa consisted of outlying portions of the parishes of Woodhall,
Langton, Thornton and Thimbleby, these villages themselves being
distant from four and a half to seven miles.&nbsp; A person
standing in the centre of the cross-roads, near the present
Church of St. Andrew, could have one foot in Langton (his right),
the other in Woodhall (his left) and hold his walking stick
before him resting in Thornton.&nbsp; The nearest portion of
Thimbleby began some 500 yards away northward, opposite the
present blacksmith&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The portion of Langton
extended from St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church to Mill-lane, near the
present Kirkstead Station.&nbsp; Thornton extended on the
opposite, southern, side of the Kirkstead Wharf-road, from the
present station, for a distance of some miles eastward, with the
parish of Kirkstead running parallel to it on the south.&nbsp;
The portion of Woodhall extended eastward from the aforesaid
point at the cross-roads, and included Woodhall Spa and other
land lying north and further east.&nbsp; In Mill-lane there was
(<i>a</i>) a Presbyterian Chapel, served by a minister residing
at Horncastle, also (<i>b</i>) a Wesleyan Chapel on the
Kirkstead-road, the minister (a layman) being also resident in
Horncastle.&nbsp; The only Church of England service in the near
neighbourhood was held at the beautiful little church in the
fields, distant about a mile to the southwest, being part of the
remains of Kirkstead Abbey; but as this benefice was a donative,
or &ldquo;peculiar,&rdquo; not under episcopal jurisdiction, <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> it might be opened or closed, and
stipend paid to a minister or withheld, according to the will of
the proprietor for the time being of the Kirkstead Estate.&nbsp;
The services have, therefore, at times been performed somewhat
irregularly, and it has now been closed since about 1880.&nbsp;
Owing to the distance of the district from the parent parishes
and its inaccessibility, the religious interests of the
inhabitants had, at that time, been much neglected.&nbsp; It was
said that they lived on a <i>heath</i>, and were, many of them,
virtually <i>heathens</i>.&nbsp; And this was in truth only a
slight exaggeration, for many of them attended no place of
worship, they rarely were visited by a minister of any
denomination, and many of their children were unbaptized; and
when, a few years later, there was a resident curate, he broke
down under the weight of his spiritual responsibilities amid such
a population.&nbsp; A change, however, in this respect was
effected <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>during the forties.&nbsp; The Rev.
Edward Walter, Rector of Langton and Vicar of Old Woodhall, two
of the parent parishes, whose name is still held in reverence
among the older inhabitants of Woodhall Spa, took up the
matter.&nbsp; He held Church of England services for a time in a
room at the hotel.&nbsp; He then got together an influential
committee, with the Honourable Sir Henry Dymoke, the
Queen&rsquo;s champion, at their head, <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> and they raised a sum of money, to
which, among others, the Queen and the Dowager Queen Adelaide <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> contributed, sufficient at first to
erect a school and school-house, where the services were
temporarily conducted; and finally for the Church of St. Andrew
and the vicarage, which were erected in 1847, the church being
consecrated by Bishop Kaye, of Lincoln, on Sept. 14th in that
year.&nbsp; The architect was Mr. Stephen Lewin, of Boston, who
built several other churches in the neighbourhood, notably that
of Sausthorpe, near Spilsby, which is a very fine edifice. <a
name="citation14c"></a><a href="#footnote14c"
class="citation">[14c]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>The Rev. E. Walter at first endowed the benefice with
&pound;20 a year and 30 acres of land, others giving smaller
donations.&nbsp; Subsequently, when some church land was sold in
the parent parish of Woodhall, which would have augmented his own
benefice, he conveyed &pound;230 a year to the benefice of
Woodhall Spa; or, as it was then called, Langton St. Andrew, as
the church stood on part of Langton Glebe; and this was augmented
in 1889 by his son, through the sale of land, formerly Langton
Glebe, to the extent of a further &pound;112.&nbsp; We may fitly
add that the Rev. E. Walter rests in the churchyard of St.
Andrew, the place of his own creation, with the tombs of other
members of his family near his own.&nbsp; Were a worthy epitaph
needed, it might well be, <i>simonumentum qu&aelig;ris
circumspice</i>.&nbsp; No one, in his sphere, has been a greater
benefactor to Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; It should be added that a large
Wesleyan Chapel was subsequently built; also a Primitive
Methodist Chapel, and more recently a Roman Catholic Chapel, with
resident priest.&nbsp; The various parochial sections were
constituted one ecclesiastical district in the year 1854; and in
recent years have, with some portions of the parishes of
Kirkstead and Martin, been made one civil parish, with its Urban
Council.</p>
<p>In the year 1884, the late Stafford Hotchkin, Esq., proprietor
of the Woodhall Estate, expended a considerable sum in
re-furnishing the Victoria Hotel, and making other improvements,
in a costly style; and in 1887 the hotel and bathhouse, with
about 100 acres of the estate, were purchased by an influential
syndicate, who have since laid out a very great amount in the
enlargement of the hotel and grounds, the improvement of, and
additions to, the bathhouse, in supplying expensive automatic
machinery for the well, and other developments for the
convenience or entertainment of visitors. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; This gave a great impetus to the
growth of the place generally.&nbsp; Another hotel, the
&ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; was erected, which is excellently
conducted.&nbsp; A very large establishment, the Royal Hotel,
with winter garden, etc., has been built by Mr. Adolphus Came,
embracing an area of 1,000 <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>square yards,
covered by a glazed roof, and holding out many attractions during
the season; while streets of lodging houses, semi-detached or
single villas, and handsome residences have sprung up in all
directions.&nbsp; With the growth of the population came a need
for enlarged church accommodation; and the present St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church was erected by subscription at a cost of
over &pound;1,800, and was opened by the Bishop on Sept. 14th,
1893, the foundation stone having been laid in the previous year
by the Right Honble.&nbsp; E. Stanhope, M.P., Secretary for
War.&nbsp; It comprised, at first, only nave and South aisle; in
1904 chancel, organ chamber and vestry were added, and the church
was consecrated by the Bishop on St. Peter&rsquo;s Day, June 29,
in that year; the total cost being about &pound;3,700.&nbsp;
There is a fine organ, and peal of tubular bells.&nbsp; The
interior fittings are mainly the gifts of generous friends.&nbsp;
The altar rails and sanctuary carpet were given by Mrs. Randolph
Berens, of London, a frequent visitor to the Spa.&nbsp; The very
ornate reredos, occupying the whole width of the east end, was
presented by Mrs. Cator, of Fairmead Lodge, in memory of her
husband, the late Colonel Cator.&nbsp; It is of oak, richly
pinnacled and crocketted.&nbsp; The centre panel contains a basso
relievo representation of the triple Crucifixion, with the Virgin
and St. John in niches on either side.&nbsp; Above are the
emblems of the four Evangelists.&nbsp; The buttresses are crowned
by the four Archangels, SS. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and
Uriel.&nbsp; Over the super-altar is the inscription, in raised
letters, &ldquo;And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto
me&rdquo;; the inscription on the wings being &ldquo;Ad Majorem,
Dei gloriam, et in piam memoriaun Thom&oelig; Gulielmi Cator, qui
in Christo obdormivit die xiv&deg; Januarii.&nbsp; A.S.&nbsp;
MDCCCC.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the work of Messrs. Hems and Sons,
of Exeter.&nbsp; The pulpit, of handsome carved oak, executed by
the same artists, was presented by Lieutenant Stafford Vere
Hotchkin, of the 21st Lancers Regiment, in memory of his father,
the late T. J. Stafford Hotchkin, lord of the manor.</p>
<p>Of this church we can only say that all true lovers of
architecture must regret the style in which it was erected.&nbsp;
The original idea, strenuously advocated by the late Bishop
Suffragan, Dr. E. Trollope, one of our greatest authorities (as
well as by the present writer, as patron of the benefice) was
that the Church of St. Andrew should be enlarged by doubling the
nave and extending the chancel.&nbsp; Arrangements <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>had
been made to obtain stone for this purpose from the ruins of
Stixwold Priory, of which that church was originally built.&nbsp;
A suitable edifice would thus have been erected, in a central
position.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Bishop died while the question
was yet <i>sub judice</i>, and, as most persons of taste must
feel, counsels less wise prevailed.&nbsp; The present structure
of brick has been called a barn; it is of no architectural
pretensions; the tracery of the windows is of the most meagre
description.&nbsp; The ground around it is too limited to be used
for burial, although the churchyard of St. Andrew is rapidly
filling, and at no distant date a cemetery must be provided.</p>
<p>The writer, while incumbent of Woodhall Spa, in conjunction
with Mr. R. Cuffe, M.R.C.S., then lessee of the Victoria Hotel,
commenced, in 1873, a Cottage Hospital for the poor, on a small
scale, which was largely beneficial, patients being admitted
almost literally from Land&rsquo;s End to John
o&rsquo;Groats&rsquo; house.&nbsp; Some left their crutches
behind them, nailed to the walls of the bathhouse; and it may be
added, as shewing the efficacy of the water, that cases occurred
of patients who, on their arrival, could only get about painfully
on crutches, but who yet, before leaving, ran in foot races at
the village sports.&nbsp; The cottage then rented has of late
years been superseded by the much larger Alexandra Hospital, a
substantial building, under the patronage of the Princess of
Wales, erected through the exertions of the Rev. J. O. Stephens,
rector of Blankney, on a site presented by the syndicate.&nbsp;
It was opened in 1890, and has conferred large benefits on the
suffering poor.&nbsp; The medical officer is Dr. Williams,
L.R.C.P., Ed., Brookside Cottage, by whom patients are treated
with great skill.&nbsp; He has published a pamphlet on the
Woodhall water and treatment.&nbsp; He is ably assisted by Mr. H.
W. Gwyn, L.S.A.&nbsp; A pamphlet on the same subject was also
published by the late Mr. A. E. Boulton, M.R.C.S.,
Horncastle.&nbsp; Mr. R. Cuffe, M.R.C.S., Surgeon-Major, has also
a large residence, the Northcote House Sanatorium, for the
reception of high-class patients, who are under his own
supervision.&nbsp; He has had a large and long experience in
every variety of ailment for which the Woodhall treatment is
adapted, having been sole lessee of the Spa establishment from
1866 to 1883; he has written much on the subject; was himself
mainly instrumental in founding the British Balneological and
Climatological Society, which has as its members the <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>leading physicians of the chief watering places in the
kingdom; and at his hands patients receive the most scientific
treatment, he having been the first to introduce, many years ago,
the electrolytic treatment, so effective in internal cases.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Home for Gentlewomen,&rdquo; in reduced
circumstances, and needing the Woodhall treatment, was
established in 1894 by the present writer, in co-operation with
Mr. Cuffe, as hon. medical officer.&nbsp; It is under the
patronage of his Grace the Duke of Rutland, and other
distinguished persons.&nbsp; It was at first located in two
bungalows, but now occupies a roomy residence on the
Horncastle-road.&nbsp; It has been very generously supported, and
has proved a great boon in many needy cases.</p>
<p>The annals of the Woodhall neighbourhood are not without their
tragic features; and deeds of lawlessness have occurred equal to
anything of the kind recorded in modern times.</p>
<p>On June 22nd, in the year 1822, a young man named Stennet
Jeffrey was returning from Horncastle Fair to the farm of his
employer, Mr. Warrener (still occupied by members of the same
family), when, as he was passing along the footpath through a
part of Whitehall Wood, called &ldquo;the Wilderness,&rdquo; he
was attacked by, as was supposed at the time, two men against
whom he had given information of their poaching.&nbsp; They were
accompanied by a female named Sophy Motley, still remembered by
some of my informants as a big, masculine woman.&nbsp; After a
desperate struggle for his life, a track being trampled down
round the tree, by which he tried to elude them (the grass, as
tradition says, never growing again afterwards), he was
overpowered and foully done to death.&nbsp; His body was found
thrown into the ditch near at hand, with the throat cut.&nbsp;
They carried off his watch, which he had bought at the fair that
day, and his money.&nbsp; A sovereign was found near the spot a
few years afterwards by a man who was ploughing in the adjoining
field.&nbsp; The present writer remembers being told in after
years, by a man living at Woodhall, who was at the time working
in a field not far off, that he heard cries for help, but did not
know what they meant, and so the poor fellow was left to struggle
unaided in the unequal conflict.&nbsp; The tree has been seen by
the writer, round which he tried to escape.&nbsp; It stood at the
south-west end of the path through the wood, about two miles from
Woodhall Spa, and was inscribed with the rudely-cut names of many
a visitor to <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the spot.&nbsp; The parties to the
murder were supposed to have come from Coningsby Moor, and this
was confirmed by the fact that they afterwards stopped for
refreshment at a small public house kept by Mrs. Copping, at
Fulsby, which lay in the direction of Coningsby Moor.&nbsp; Near
there some bloodstained clothes were found concealed in a
hedge.&nbsp; A reward of &pound;100 was offered for their
apprehension.&nbsp; The woman Copping, at the public-house, was,
it is said, fully aware of their guilt, but dared not say
anything about it.&nbsp; The two men were convicted, and
transported for life.&nbsp; The woman Motley was arrested on
suspicion, but there was not sufficient evidence to convict
her.&nbsp; In after years a man at Coningsby, named Paul Tomline,
confessed on his deathbed that he had been a third party to the
murder, having assisted in holding Jeffrey down while his throat
was being cut.&nbsp; It is further stated that the woman, Sophy
Motley, on her deathbed, said that the stolen watch would be
found at the bottom of her box.</p>
<p>In the forties and fifties poaching was carried on in so
openly defiant a manner, and on so formidable a scale, as is
seldom heard of in these days.&nbsp; The writer was a party
concerned in the following incident, not, be it said, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Woodhall, although within easy reach
of it.&nbsp; While he was visiting a worthy baronet for the
purpose of shooting with him, they were informed by the
head-keeper, as they met him one morning after breakfast, that he
had received a private intimation that a gang of poachers, living
in a neighbouring town, had chartered a special train to bring
them down, on the following evening, to shoot some of the
preserves, the line of railway skirting the property.&nbsp; We at
once decided to give them a warm reception.&nbsp; This was not an
entirely new thing for which we were unprepared, and the keeper
had a most powerful mastiff, a monster Cerberus, who could plant
his forepaws on the stoutest man&rsquo;s shoulders and pull him
down.&nbsp; The baronet&rsquo;s only son, the writer&rsquo;s
great friend, with whom he had walked many a league in the Alps,
and many a mile&mdash;with its &ldquo;bittock&rdquo;&mdash;over
the Scotch moors, was &ldquo;keen for the fray.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
less so was the writer.&nbsp; As the estate comprised three
parishes, and it was not known at what point the poachers would
&ldquo;detrain,&rdquo; it was evident that we should have an
extended frontier to protect, and it was decided at once to
despatch a messenger to the owner of an adjoining estate, the
M.P. for the Division, asking for the loan of his keepers, to
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>co-operate with our own.&nbsp; Watchers were to be sent
to various points, swift-footed vedettes, to come into immediate
touch with the enemy on their arrival, and to report the
direction taken by them, and their number.&nbsp; Everything was
arranged in good time before the morning was over.&nbsp; It was
settled that the keeper was to come to the hall at 9 p.m., when
the son and the writer would be ready to join them.&nbsp; We were
none of us to take firearms, but to be furnished with stout
sticks.&nbsp; The evening passed slowly, in our eagerness for the
&ldquo;joust.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at nine o&rsquo;clock the keeper
came with a look of disappointment on his countenance.&nbsp; News
had got abroad of the preparations we had made for the
gang&rsquo;s reception; an ally, lurking near, had telegraphed
that it would not be safe for them to venture on their raid, and
the train had been countermanded.&nbsp; Since then the genial
baronet has &ldquo;crossed the bar,&rdquo; as a Lincolnshire poet
hath it; but of late the writer has had the pleasure, almost
annually, of meeting her ladyship at Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; She was
brought up in a parish closely connected with Woodhall, and she
may almost be said to return to her &ldquo;native heath&rdquo; to
renew her years.</p>
<p>The reader will please excuse this digression, as it
illustrates the condition of things under which occurred the
incident of local history which I am now about to give.</p>
<p>A no less atrocious murder than that in the Wilderness was
committed, within less than a mile of the same place, at
Well-Syke Wood, which again is about two miles from Woodhall
Spa.&nbsp; The shooting of the wood belonged to the Rev. John
Dymoke, afterwards the champion, who rented it from Lord
Fortescue.&nbsp; In the year 1850, the head keeper, Richard
Tasker, received a written intimation that a gang of poachers
intended to visit the wood on a certain night, and the writer of
the letter recommended him, for his own sake, to keep away.&nbsp;
Tasker, however, was lodging not far from the wood, with a small
farmer named Emanuel Howden, who also occasionally acted as a
watchman; and the two men, accompanied by the
&ldquo;rabbiter,&rdquo; James Donner, went to the wood, to
protect their master&rsquo;s pheasants.&nbsp; Howden hung back,
not liking the undertaking; Donner went off to watch the wood
from another point.&nbsp; Presently a shot was heard, and on
Howden and Donner coming to Tasker, they found him lying on the
ground severely wounded, and he died the following day.&nbsp; It
was a bright moonlight <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>night, <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a> and Donner tried,
for a time, to follow the poachers, but they eluded him.&nbsp;
This occurred in a field just outside Well-Syke Wood, at the
north-west corner, then occupied by William Hutchinson,
grandfather of the present tenant, whose house adjoins the
Horncastle-road, some two miles from Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; Most of
the poachers were believed to have come from Horsington; two of
them, brothers, named Bowring, and a third, Pearson Clarke, and
another named Hinds; a man named Stennet was also arrested on
suspicion; but they were all eventually discharged, there being
no means of identifying them, as the murdered man was the only
one who came to close quarters with any of them.&nbsp; Along with
these, it is believed there was also a man named Joseph Kent,
from Tattershall Thorpe, who is supposed to have fired the fatal
shot.&nbsp; As Tasker approached the wood, this man came forward
and recommended him to go home.&nbsp; Tasker called out that he
was not yet going home, and that he knew him, whereupon Kent,
finding that he was recognised, fined the shot. <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>The following is a less exciting incident.&nbsp; A few years
later a man, representing himself as a beggar, called at
Kirkstead Hall, about a mile from Woodhall Spa, asking for
relief.&nbsp; Something was given to him, but it not being
sufficient to satisfy his desires, he indulged in threatening
language, unless he was treated <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>more
liberally.&nbsp; At length he became so violent that the door was
closed in his face, and he was told that they would fetch the
constable, whereupon he went off.&nbsp; The female inmates, being
afraid that he might return, if they were left alone, thought it
safest to send for the constable, and he, with the keeper,
followed the man and apprehended him.&nbsp; He was handcuffed,
his feet tightly tied together, and put by them into a cart, in
which the constable, without the keeper, drove off to Horncastle,
to place him in the lock-up, then called &ldquo;The Round
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; As they journeyed on their way, near the
&ldquo;Tower on the Moor,&rdquo; the man, lying at the bottom of
the cart, complained to the constable that the cords on his legs
were cutting into the flesh; &ldquo;Would he take them
off?&rdquo; adding that the handcuffs secured him fast
enough.&nbsp; The constable accordingly got down from his seat,
and took off the cords.&nbsp; As he was remounting, the man slipt
out of the cart behind, and, bounding off into the wood,
&ldquo;Ostler&rsquo;s Plantations,&rdquo; close by, turned, as he
mounted the boundary bank, defying the constable to follow
him.&nbsp; The latter could not leave his horse, and, the man
being very powerfully built, he also knew that he was more than a
match for him single handed.&nbsp; The man disappeared.&nbsp;
Some one coming up assisted the constable to tie up his horse and
make a search for the prisoner; but all they found were the
handcuffs, which he had wrenched off, lying inside the wood not
far away.&nbsp; Two present inhabitants of Woodhall saw the
constable pass their house, driving the cart with the man lying
in it.</p>
<p>A very remarkable burglary was committed about two miles from
Woodhall Spa on February 2nd, 1829, at Halstead Hall, a fine
specimen of a &ldquo;Moated Grange,&rdquo; to which reference
will be made in another chapter.&nbsp; It was at that time
occupied by a farmer, Mr. Wm. Elsey, his wife, and farm
servants.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when the
servant men went out to &ldquo;supper up&rdquo; the horses, they
were attacked by seven or eight men, thrown down, their legs
tied, and their hands secured behind their backs, and each was
left in a separate stall.&nbsp; The stable door was then locked,
and one of the gang remained outside on guard.&nbsp; The burglars
then proceeded to the hall, and knocked at the back door.&nbsp;
One of the servant girls asked who was there.&nbsp; She received
the reply, &ldquo;Open the door, Betty.&rdquo;&nbsp; She did so,
whereupon four or five men rushed into the kitchen.&nbsp; One of
the maids escaped, and ran to the room where Mr. <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and
Mrs. Elsey were sitting.&nbsp; Mr. Elsey was smoking his pipe,
and Mrs. Elsey was preparing something for supper.&nbsp; She
saved her silver spoon, which she was using, by slipping it into
her bosom.&nbsp; Mr. Elsey seized the poker to defend himself,
but, on seeing their number, prudently laid it down.&nbsp; They
then rifled his pockets and took his watch and money; also making
Mrs. Elsey turn her pockets out.&nbsp; They then obliged the two
to go into a small storeroom or closet, locked the door, and tied
a hay fork across it.&nbsp; They then collected all the plate, to
the value of &pound;30, and &pound;50 in cash; having first
regaled themselves with a hearty meal.&nbsp; They also took all
the silk handkerchiefs which they could find.&nbsp; Mrs. Elsey,
in her confinement close by, complained to the burglars that she
was very cold, and begged them to let her warm herself at the
fire; accordingly, with the gallantry of a Dick Turpin, one of
them brought her out, but seeing that she was noticing them, he
ordered her into the store-room again, giving her, however, some
greatcoats which were hanging in the passage near.&nbsp; When
they had ransacked everything within reach, they compelled Mr.
Elsey to go upstairs, one walking before him and another behind,
each holding a pistol, and telling him that if he made any
resistance he would be shot.&nbsp; They then, in the same
fashion, obliged Mrs. Elsey to go up after him.&nbsp; The two
were then locked up again, and the marauders politely wished them
goodnight, and went off with their plunder, saying that if any
alarm was given they would return.&nbsp; Mr. Elsey, about two
hours afterwards, by the help of a small hammer and an old knife,
succeeded in making a small hole through the brick wall of the
closet, through which one of the maids was able to thrust her
arm, and set them at liberty.&nbsp; The only article recovered
was a plated silver teapot, which was found in Halstead Wood,
near at hand.&nbsp; Outside this wood ran a bridle path leading
towards Woodhall Spa, and in the course of the night the inmates
of a farmhouse, standing close to this path, were disturbed by
the voices of men passing by toward &ldquo;the Spa.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One of these men was soon captured, and in due course hanged at
Lincoln Castle on March 27th following; two more were taken that
year, and hanged on March 19th in the next year, 1830.&nbsp; Of
these two, one was known as &ldquo;Tippler,&rdquo; the other as
&ldquo;Tiger Tom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tiger Tom&rdquo; had been
the terror of the neighbourhood, and the general opinion was that
no one could take him.&nbsp; But <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>two
powerfully built and fearless men, David English, of Hameringham,
and a gamekeeper named Bullivant, were set to accomplish the
task, and they succeeded in running their man to ground, and
securing him at &ldquo;The Bungalow,&rdquo; a public-house on the
Witham, near Boston. <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; With them was
hanged another noted character known as &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;
Clarke, convicted of sheep-stealing.&nbsp; His was the last case
of hanging for that offence.&nbsp; The last of the gang was not
captured till two years later.&nbsp; He was the one who had
planned the whole affair, having formerly been a servant of Mr.
Elsey, and therefore well acquainted with the premises at the
Hall.&nbsp; He, however, escaped hanging, being transported for
life, as the excitement over the affair had by that time cooled
down; and, further, it was pleaded in his favour, that he had
prevented a bad character among them, named Timothy Brammar, from
shooting Mr. Elsey, or ill-treating the maids.&nbsp; Of this same
Timothy Brammar it is recorded that his own mother having
foretold that he would &ldquo;die in his shoes,&rdquo; he
carefully kicked them off as he stood on the scaffold, to falsify
the prediction.&nbsp; It is further stated that the man
transported was, with two other criminals sent out at the same
time, thrown overboard, as the three were caught trying to sink
the vessel in which they were being conveyed &ldquo;beyond the
seas.&rdquo;&nbsp; These men, with the exception of this former
servant of Mr. Elsey, were all &ldquo;bankers,&rdquo; as they
were then called, <i>i.e.</i>, navvies; and such men in those
days were usually a very truculent class.&nbsp; A robbery of a
minor kind was cleverly frustrated in Woodhall about the year
1850.&nbsp; A labourer&rsquo;s wife, residing at a cottage on
what is now called &ldquo;Redcap Farm,&rdquo; had been taking her
husband&rsquo;s dinner to him in the fields.&nbsp; On returning,
rather earlier than usual, she went to the bedroom
upstairs.&nbsp; While in the room she detected the legs of a man,
who had concealed himself under the bed.&nbsp; Retaining her
presence of mind, she merely made a trifling remark to her cat,
and went down again, and for some minutes made a <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>noise, as though busying herself about her usual
household work.&nbsp; She presently got out of the house, and ran
to some men working near.&nbsp; The thief thinking, by her cool
behaviour, that she had not noticed him, remained still in his
place of concealment; and she quickly returned, accompanied by
two men, who captured him; when he was found to be a well-known
thief, who had been convicted more than once of similar
offences.&nbsp; Not far from the scene of this occurrence,
another attempted robbery was frustrated.&nbsp; An aged couple
lived in a solitary house, distant from any high road, near the
wood called &ldquo;Edlington Scrubs.&rdquo;&nbsp; After they had
gone to rest a couple of men broke into the house.&nbsp; Hearing
a disturbance, the wife opened the one bedroom door upstairs,
connected with the room below by a &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s
ladder,&rdquo; and looked down through the trap door at the
ladder head, with a &ldquo;dip&rdquo; in her hand, to see the
cause of the disturbance.&nbsp; She was immediately accosted with
the demand, &ldquo;Your money, or your life.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
replied, very deliberately, &ldquo;Well, life is not worth having
without the money.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the men began mounting the
ladder, but meanwhile the husband had armed himself with a strong
bill-hook, a tool for cutting hedges; he took his place by the
trap door, and said to the burglar on the ladder, &ldquo;I shall
cut your head off if you come up here.&rdquo;&nbsp; This position
he maintained, moving his weapon backwards and forwards over the
trap door, his figure being revealed to the thieves by the light
of his wife&rsquo;s dip, until day began to break, when, to avoid
being recognised, they went off, having to content themselves
with what spoil the second man could find in the room
below.&nbsp; On another occasion, a narrow escape from highway
robbery occurred in Woodhall under the following
circumstances.&nbsp; It was at the time of the great August Fair
at Horncastle, much larger at that time (in the forties) than it
is at the present day; for it then lasted some three weeks.&nbsp;
That fair has been the occasion of many robberies, and more than
one murder.&nbsp; Skeletons have been found buried under the
brick floors of public-houses in the town, being doubtless all
that remained of those who had fallen the victims of the
&ldquo;sacra fames auri.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principal farmer in
Woodhall was riding home leisurely from the fair late in the
evening, when at a point in the road between Langton and
Woodhall, about two fields from Old Woodhall Church, where a
cartshed then stood contiguous to the road, two men rushed out
from the <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>concealment of the shed and seized
his bridle.&nbsp; One of them told him roughly to give up his
money, or he would pistol him.&nbsp; The other held up a lantern
to his face, and then said, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not the man
we want; you may go, and think yourself lucky.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
farmer in question was not much of a horse-dealer, and would not
be likely to have much money about him.&nbsp; The man really
wanted was a well-known character, then living at Stixwould, by
name Grantham, who would be almost certain to be going home with
pockets fairly full, as he dealt largely in horse-flesh, and the
men had probably seen him make a good bargain or two in the fair
that day.&nbsp; The farmer, thus set at liberty, hurried to his
home, only two fields distant; and, having a shrewd guess for
whom they were lying in wait, he sent an active young fellow by a
short cut across the fields to warn Grantham.&nbsp; The lad
succeeded in intercepting the latter before he arrived at the
point of danger; and Grantham, turning his horse round, rode home
by another route, through Thimbleby, instead of Woodhall, and
arrived at his house in safety, thanks to the thoughtfulness of a
neighbour.</p>
<p>There are some good historic names among the older residents
of the Woodhall Spa district.&nbsp; Howard is one, a name, which
still stands high in the peerage of England.&nbsp; Gaunt is
another frequent name; some of the members of the family, in the
fine build of their bodily frame and their dark hair and
complexion, seeming to indicate descent from ancient Norman
blood.&nbsp; Fynes, or more properly Fiennes, is another;
implying a connection with the Ducal House of Newcastle; the
father of the present generation (a former tenant of the writer)
having been named Charles Pelham Fynes.&nbsp; Monuments of the
Fiennes family are common in neighbouring parishes, and they
still hold considerable property in the surrounding district.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; NATURE NOTES.</h2>
<p>The great charm of Woodhall Spa is its &ldquo;Rus in
Urbe&rdquo; character.&nbsp; The visitor can hardly go for ten
minutes in any direction from his hotel or lodgings but he finds
himself by the woodside, among the hedgerows or on the heath,
where the jaded spirit, or the enfeebled frame, may draw fresh
energy from the bracing air, richly charged with ozone, and even
at times perceptibly impregnated with the tonic flavour of the
iodine.&nbsp; The author of a recent publication <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>who
visited Woodhall Spa, in 1897, says: &ldquo;Woodhall is as unlike
the usual run of fashionable watering places as one can well
imagine.&nbsp; It is a charming health resort&mdash;situated on a
dry, sandy soil, where fir trees flourish&mdash;there are wild
moors, purple with heather, and aglow with golden gorse; a land
of health, and the air deliciously bracing.&nbsp; I do not think
(he adds) there is a purer or more exhilarating air to be found
in all England, or for that matter out of it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>Of the surrounding scenery it need hardly be said that we are
not in the land of &ldquo;the mountain,&rdquo; though we have the
&ldquo;brown heath, and shaggy wood,&rdquo; and occasionally, not
far off, &ldquo;the flood,&rdquo; sung of by Scotia&rsquo;s
bard.&nbsp; But within sight are the Wolds, whose precipitous
sides have, to my knowledge, astonished strangers, who, judging
from the country traversed by the railway from Peterborough,
expected to find the whole county as level as a billiard table.
<a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a>&nbsp; The flatness of the country,
however, is amply made up for by other redeeming features.&nbsp;
Within a mile of the Spa a view is obtained stretching more than
20 miles, with the grand Cathedral (which Ruskin says is
&ldquo;worth any two others in the kingdom&rdquo;) crowning the
&ldquo;steep&rdquo; hill of Lincoln on the horizon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,&rdquo;
says the poet Campbell; and this prospect, slightly undulating,
with extensive woods barring it at intervals, and village spires
rising from their midst, seen through the marvellously clear
atmosphere which we often enjoy, is a sight worth seeing.</p>
<p>An old writer <a name="citation27c"></a><a href="#footnote27c"
class="citation">[27c]</a> describes the air as being
&ldquo;crass, and full of rotten harrs&rdquo;; and Drayton, <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>in his &ldquo;Polyolbion&rdquo; <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a> speaks of the &ldquo;unwholesome ayre,
and more unwholesome soyle&rdquo;; but that condition of things
has long ago passed away.&nbsp; Another charming effect of these
distant prospects is the glorious sunsets.&nbsp; Kingsley, in his
&ldquo;Hereward the Wake,&rdquo; truly says, the &ldquo;vastness
gives such cloudlands, such sunrises, such sunsets, as can be
seen nowhere else in these isles.&rdquo;&nbsp; A writer, whom I
have already quoted, says, &ldquo;I am inclined to think the sky
scenery, if I may be allowed the term, the finest and most
wonderful in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to &ldquo;its gorgeous
sunsets, you look upon an atmosphere saturated with colour, so
that it becomes opalesque; and the sinking sun, seen through the
vibrating air, is magnificent.&nbsp; From the slopes of far
California I have looked down upon the sun dipping into the wide
Pacific, amid a riot of colour, but nothing like this.&rdquo; <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; Nor is this any
exaggeration.&nbsp; The visitor to Woodhall may see it for
himself, and the writer has often gazed upon it.&nbsp; Towards
evening the soft blue of the distance becomes gradually lit up by
the lowering sun with the most gorgeous and varied shades of
purple, gold, and ruby, until he sinks below the horizon in a
blaze of crimson glory.&nbsp; Then follow, softer, more mellowed
tints of violet, pink, emerald green, exquisite greys, and
varying hues of the most delicate kinds, until they slowly fade
away into the shades of night, or the silvery sheen of the
moon.</p>
<p>For the student of nature, there are special attractions in
the botany of the neighbourhood; scarcely less in its
ornithology.&nbsp; The wild, four-footed creatures also are in
unusual variety; and within easy reach the antiquarian will find
objects of very special interest.</p>
<p>In these pages it would be impossible to treat of all these
subjects fully.</p>
<p>I will take botany first.&nbsp; And I would here make the
preliminary observation, that, in specifying different plants to
be found in the near vicinity, I shall not indicate exactly the
<i>habitat</i> of each, for the sake of preserving to Woodhall
Spa in the future some of its choicest attractions.&nbsp; The
track of the invading tourist is too often marked by
massacre.&nbsp; A French ambassador, describing some years ago
the country life of our gentry, said that one of the first
proposals, made after breakfast by the host, would be, &ldquo;Let
us go out and kill something&rdquo;; and this national tendency
has disastrously affected our Flora as well as our Fauna.&nbsp; A
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>writer has said, &ldquo;There is a base sort of botanist
who prods up choice treasures wantonly to destroy them.&nbsp;
They are murderers, to be classed with those who have stamped the
quagga out of Africa, or those who fly to firearms if Nature
sends a rare migrant creature of air, or earth, or water, in
their way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Go through our English lakes, as the
writer did recently, after not having visited them for several
years, and you will find, for instance, the falls of Lodore,
where once the parsley-fern abounded, now entirely stript of
it.&nbsp; Just as&mdash;to take a parallel case&mdash;in a
certain stream in Borrowdale, where some years ago the writer
caught so many trout that the widow, in whose cottage he lodged,
offered to keep him any length of time gratis, so long as he
would supply her with fish at the same rate; now, in that stream
hardly a fish is to be caught, from its so constantly being
&ldquo;flogged&rdquo; by the tourist.&nbsp; The same holds good,
though, so far, in a less degree, at Woodhall.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ichabod&rdquo; may be writ in large characters over the
record of some of the plants once plentiful.&nbsp; I shall,
therefore, leave the botanist, with few exceptions, to hunt out
the specimens for himself, only stating that they exist.&nbsp;
But is not this, after all, the chief charm of his pursuit to the
true lover of Nature?&nbsp; To have everything found to hand for
him may indeed lessen his labours, but it robs him of all the
gratification with which he can exclaim &ldquo;Eureka,&rdquo; as
his eyes rest upon the long-sought prize which he has found for
himself.&nbsp; The difference between the true botanist and the
sportsman has been thus defined: &ldquo;The sportsman seeks to
kill; the botanist seeks to find, to admire, and to
preserve.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would that it were always so.&nbsp; From
the great difference in the soils in the immediate neighbourhood,
varying from the lightest sand to the stiffest clay, or from the
peat and bog of the fen to the gravel of the moor, or the leafy
mould of the wood, there is also a very great variety of wild
plants.&nbsp; The late Rev. R. H. Webb, author of &ldquo;The
Botany of Herts,&rdquo; was some years ago a frequent visitor at
Woodhall Spa, and he assured the writer, that in all his
experience he had never known so large or so interesting a
variety as was to be found in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; On one
occasion the writer, collecting wild plants for a flower show,
gathered, in the course of a morning&rsquo;s walk, more than 110
different specimens.&nbsp; Probably the rarest plant was the
Silene Quinque vulneralis, the discovery of which led to a
lengthy correspondence, it being rarely found in England, though
fairly common in Jersey.&nbsp; <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>It was
growing in a field which now forms part of the garden of the
Victoria Hotel.&nbsp; The alterations necessary to make that
transformation extinguished it, or rather buried it out of sight;
but as some correspondents gave instances where it had recurred
in localities in which it had for years been unknown, there is no
absolute reason why it should not also reappear in this
case.&nbsp; Should it do so, we can only cry, <i>parce</i>,
<i>precor</i>, to the too ruthless collector.&nbsp; The Osmunda
Regalis, again, a few years ago was very plentiful; the writer
has had plants of it which grew to be three, four, and even five
feet in height, but it is now quite extinct.&nbsp; Not only so,
but the writer, finding this to be the case, replanted some roots
of it in 1897, where he fondly hoped they would escape
observation, but, on going to look for them the following year,
he found the soil dug up all round the place by the trespassing
marauder, and not a trace of them was left.</p>
<p>The following plants have been mentioned by different
authorities as among those which are be found.&nbsp; The Rev. E.
Adrian Woodruffe Peacock, secretary to the Lincolnshire
Naturalists&rsquo; Union, says: &ldquo;We may expect to find some
of the following rare plants&mdash;Ranunculus Hederaceus,
Corydalis claviculata, Raphanus Raphanistrum, Silene
Quinque-Vulnera (most rare), Silene Anglica (not so rare), Vicia
Bobartii, Cotyledon Umbilicus, Sedum Villosum, Sedum Reflexum,
Drosera Anglica, Epilobium Tetragonum, Campanula
Ranunculoides.&nbsp; At a meeting of the Alford
Naturalists&rsquo; Society the secretary exhibited the following
plants, obtained from the Woodhall district, presenting a
striking difference to the plants found about Alford, owing to
the sandy moorland soil of Woodhall:&mdash;Calluna Erica (ling),
Erica Tetralix (cross-leaved heath), Artemisia Vulgaris
(mugwort).&nbsp; Marrubium Vulgare (white horehound), Teucrium
Scorodonia (wood sage), Hydrocotyle Vulgaris (white-rot), and the
Hardfern (Lomaria Spicant); also fruiting specimens of Solidago
Virgaurea (golden rod), Lepidium Campestre (field pepper-wort),
Cotyledon Umbilicus (wall penny-wort).&rdquo;</p>
<p>I conducted the members of the Lincoln Natural History and
Arch&aelig;ological Society round the neighbourhood a few years
ago, in the month of April, and they reported 39 plants as being
then in flower, the most interesting being Saxifraga
Tridactylites (stone-crop), Draba Verna (vernal whitlow grass),
Erodium Cicutarium (hemlock, stork&rsquo;s bill), Cotyledon <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Umbilicus (wall pennywort), and the Tussilago Petasites
(butter-bur), Stellaria Holostea (greater stitchwort); also
Parietaria Officinalis (wall pellitory), not yet in bloom, and in
a pond Stratiotes Aloides (water soldier) in great abundance.</p>
<p>More recently I conducted the members of the Lincolnshire
Natural History Union through the district, in the month of
August, and the following is a list of their chief
&ldquo;finds&rdquo;; Hieracium Boreale (hawkweed), Lysimachia
Vulgaris (yellow loose strife), Melampyrum Pratense (yellow-cow
wheat), Tycopus Europeus (gipsy-wort), Solidago Virgaurea (golden
rod), Malva Moschata (musk mallow), also a white variety of the
common mallow (Malva Sylvestris), the two cresses, Lepidium
Smithii and L. Campestre, Sparganium Simplex (simple bur-reed)
the mints (Mentha Sativa, and M. Arvensis), Lythrum Salicaria
(purple loosestrife), Geranium Columbinum (long-stalked
cranesbill), Scutellaria Galericulata (skull-cap), Polygonum
Hydropiper (water pepper), Lysimachia Nemorum (yellow pimpernel),
Rhamnus Frangula (buckthorn), Gentiana Pneumonantha (blue
gentian), Erica, Cinerea (heath), Malva Rotundifolia
(round-leaved mallow), Marrubium Vulgare (white horehound),
Calamintha Acinos (basil thyme), Eriophorum Angustifolium (cotton
grass), Narthekium Ossifragum (bog asphodel), Galeopsis Bifida
(hemp nettle), Senecio Sylvaticus (ragwort), three St.
John&rsquo;s worts, viz. Hypericum Pulchrum, H. Quaodrangulum,
and H. Perforatum, Spergula Arvensis (corn spurrey), Saponaria
Officinalis (common soap wort), Drosera Rotundifolia
(round-leaved sundew), D. Intermedia (intermediate variety),
Epilobium Macrocarpum (long-fruited willow herb), E. Parviflorum
(small flowered do.).&nbsp; E. Palustre (marsh do.), Circ&oelig;a
Lutetiana (enchanter&rsquo;s night-shade), Pimpinella Magna
(greater burnet saxifrage), Valeriana Sambucifolia (elder-leaved
valerian), Solidago Virgaunea (golden rod), Gnaphalium Sylvaticum
(high land cudwort), Hieracium Umbellatum (narrow-leaved hawk
weed), Alnus Glutinosa (common alder), Juncus Acutiflorus
(sharp-flowered rush), Anagallis Pallida (pale-coloured
pimpernel), Pedicularitis Sylvatica (dwarf red rattle),
Pinguicola Vulgaris (common butter-wort), Viola Flavicornis, also
called V. Ericetorum (yellow-horned violet). <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; The Cichorium (succory) and <!--
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Parnassia Palustris (grass of Parnassus) are found in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Myrica (&ldquo;Gale&rdquo; or
bog-myrtle) is very abundant, and a useful preventive against the
moth if placed in wardrobes or drawers.&nbsp; Like the Osmunda,
the Pinguicola (butterwort), appears to be now extinct, owing
either to drainage or to the ever-offending collector.&nbsp;
Another interesting plant which at present is not to be found,
though it may at any time recur, <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a> is the Holy thistle,
or Mary thistle (Carduus Marianus).&nbsp; Formerly plentiful, a
mile away from the Spa, about the ruins of Kirkstead Abbey, it
has been of late years entirely stubbed up by successive tenants
of the farm.&nbsp; There is one locality, about three miles
distant, to which specimens were transplanted a few years ago,
and where it still survives.&nbsp; It also grew not far from the
church of Old Woodhall, but there also farmers&rsquo; operations
have exterminated it.&nbsp; Called the &ldquo;Milk&rdquo; or
&ldquo;St. Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; thistle, because its white-veined
leaves were traditionally said to have been lashed with the
virgin&rsquo;s milk, it is doubtless a survivor from the gardens
tended and cherished by the monk of old.&nbsp; The Botrychium
Lunaria (moonwort) and Ophioglossum (adder&rsquo;s tongue) are
found within 300 yards of the Baths (occasionally intermittent
for a season); the Trichomanes (English maidenhair) grows in one
solitary place on the inner walls of a closed well, though
entirely unknown anywhere else for many miles round.&nbsp;
Several varieties of ferns grow very luxuriantly.&nbsp; Before
leaving the botany of the neighbourhood, I would direct the
reader to an appendix at the end of this volume, giving a list of
a considerable number of plants with their local vernacular
names, which was compiled for me by a naturalist, who made this
subject his special study during a prolonged sojourn at Woodhall
Spa.</p>
<p>There are several different mosses, and a great variety of
fungi.</p>
<p>This varied flora conduces to a corresponding <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>variety of insect life.&nbsp; On one of the occasions
referred to above, the following beetles were
found:&mdash;Loricera Pillicornis, Geotrupes Spiniger, G.
Stercorarius, Elaphras Cupreus, Leistotrophus Nebulosus, Hister
Stercorarius, Aphodius F&oelig;tens, A. Fimitarius, A. Sordidus,
22-Punctata, and Sph&oelig;ridium Bi-pustulatum.</p>
<p>Of butterflies there is not a great variety.&nbsp; The Papilio
Machaon (swallow-tail) used to be common about the reedy pools
and bogs near the Moor; but owing to drainage and clearance none
have been seen for several years.&nbsp; The huge heaps of the
aromatic ant were formerly very common in the woods close to the
Spa, but the eggs being a favourite food for the pheasant, and
collected by the keepers for that purpose, there seems to be none
left.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; DENIZENS OF THE WOODS,
&amp;c.&mdash;BIPEDS.</h2>
<p>I now proceed to speak of some of the birds of the
locality.&nbsp; And again it may be said, as in the case of the
wild flowers, that, from the variety of soils, there is a
corresponding abundance in the species frequenting the
neighbourhood of Woodhall.&nbsp; Unfortunately another remark
made of the flowers also applies to the birds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ichabod&rdquo; may be written in large characters over the
records of several.&nbsp; In the writer&rsquo;s youth, an old
couple lived close to the Tower on the Moor, about a mile from
the Spa, in a cabin of their own construction, made chiefly of
sods, then locally called &ldquo;bages.&rdquo; <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; Old Dawson, or
&ldquo;Tabshag,&rdquo; the soubriquet by which he was more
commonly known, lived with his wife the rather wild existence of
a squatter, on the waste, under sufferance from the owner.&nbsp;
He kept a pig, and was wont to boast that he possessed the
highest pigsty and the lowest barn in the country, because the
sty was a structure of his own erection, in the old brick tower,
above the level of the surrounding ground; while his straw was
stored in an excavation (still existing) several feet
below.&nbsp; At that time between the Tower and Bracken Wood
there was a stretch of waste land, several acres in extent,
consisting of bog, interspersed with tussocks of coarse <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>grass, and straggling alders and birches, still known by
the name of &ldquo;The Bog&rsquo;s Nook,&rdquo; or corner. <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; On this ground the common green
plover&mdash;Vanellus cristatus&mdash;then commonly called the
&ldquo;Pyewipe,&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> bred in large
numbers; the eggs were, as they are still, regarded as a
delicacy, and old &ldquo;Tabshag&rdquo; used to make a
considerable sum of money every year by sending hampers of these
eggs by coach up to London for sale.&nbsp; So familiar he was
said to be with the habits of the bird that he could tell by its
cry how many eggs were in the nest. <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a>&nbsp; This land is
now under cultivation, and the plaintive cry of the plover is
heard no more, or only seldom.&nbsp; The plover, indeed, is still
with us, but in numbers lessening every year.&nbsp; There are
probably not now as many plovers&rsquo; nests in the whole parish
as there formerly were in a single ploughed field.&nbsp; The
writer, as a boy, was somewhat of an expert in finding these
nests.&nbsp; He has watched the birds making them, which they do
by turning round and round, with the breast or belly on the
ground, thus forming a saucer-shaped hollow, in which they
sometimes place two or three fibres of twitch as a lining.&nbsp;
One bird makes three or four of such nests, and finally selects
the one which, presumably, she deems most unnoticeable.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago black game were found on the moorland called
now &ldquo;The Ostler Plantations,&rdquo; <a
name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d"
class="citation">[34d]</a> but though one still heard of them
&ldquo;in the forties,&rdquo; they were then either extinct or a
rapidly vanishing quantity.&nbsp; At the same time also the
&ldquo;boom&rdquo; of the bittern might still be heard in the
marshy parts of the same ground, but they are also now among the
has been&rsquo;s.</p>
<blockquote><p>No more shall bittern boom,<br />
No more shall blackcock crow:<br />
For both have met their doom,<br />
The sport of human foe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>From the character of the Ostler ground, formerly a very
secluded tract of mixed wood, moor, and morass, it has been
frequented by a great variety of birds. <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; The heron bred there within the
last twenty years, a solitary nest remaining in a clump of trees
in the south-west corner next to Tattershall, until it was blown
down by a gale, and, the particular tree being shortly afterwards
felled, the bird never returned.&nbsp; Drainage and the
destruction of trees by the woodman&rsquo;s axe, or by accidental
fires, have so dried the ground as to reduce greatly the numbers
of certain birds of aquatic or semi-aquatic habits.&nbsp; The
coot &ldquo;clanking&rdquo; in the sedgy pools is no more
heard.&nbsp; The moor-hen with those little, black, fluffy balls
which formed her brood scuttling over the water to hide in the
reeds, is rarely seen.&nbsp; The wild duck has, indeed, in one or
two instances nested near a still-surviving pool within the last
ten years; a nest was once found by the writer among the branches
of a pollard willow, overhanging a pool, some five or six feet
from the ground.&nbsp; He has also shot teal on odd occasions
lying in the open; but both these birds are now rarely seen, and
the same may be said of the snipe, &ldquo;jack&rdquo; and
&ldquo;full.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter were once plentiful, so that
it was a common occurrence to put up a &ldquo;whisp&rdquo; of
them, whereas now one seldom sees more than three or four in a
whole season.&nbsp; A delicate little bird, very palatable on the
table, was the waterrail, now almost extinct.&nbsp; The writer
used to have permission to shoot along the &ldquo;ballast
ponds&rdquo; beside the railway, and he has frequently shot them
there.&nbsp; The woodcock is still with us.&nbsp; The poet
painter, Dante Rosetti, kept one as a favourite pet; we of <!--
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Woodhall are more prosaic, and like to see the bird rise
out of the bracken before us, and fall to our shot, eventually to
appear nicely cooked on a toast before us at table.&nbsp; But of
late years drainage has reduced their numbers.&nbsp; Although we
could, of course, never at Woodhall, compete with the shooter on
the Irish bogs, where as many as 100 or 200 are sometimes shot in
a day; yet I could at one time almost always get a brace when I
wanted them by trying certain spots which were their regular
resort, and among my notes I find this: &ldquo;Nov. 16, 1872,
shot Bracken wood, got five woodcock, making 20 in three
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; [N.B.&mdash;Bracken wood, as the visitor may
not know, is within one field of the Bath-house at Woodhall
Spa.]&nbsp; Some years ago certain sportsmen (?) in this
neighbourhood used to go to the sea coast every year, in October,
at the time of the arrival of the first flight of woodcock (the
second flight is in November), and shot them in considerable
numbers, when they were resting, exhausted by their flight;
hardly a creditable practice, and unworthy of a true lover of
nature.&nbsp; A wood in Kirkstead, named &ldquo;Bird-Hag
Wood,&rdquo; was formerly a favourite haunt of the woodcock, and
I have shot many in it; but it was cleared away in the seventies.
<a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; Woodcock occasionally breed on
the moor, and a nest was found some years ago within 80 yards of
the road to Horncastle, opposite the Tower on the Moor.&nbsp;
Among my notes I find this: &ldquo;Dec. 5, 1872, we saw about a
dozen woodcock in Bird-Hag Wood, but only three were
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have just mentioned Bird-Hag and its woodcock.&nbsp;
Pleasant memories of that wood have lingered with more than one
sportsman.&nbsp; A former poetic owner of Kirkstead has written
of it thus <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Remote Bird-Hag, that favourite
preserve,<br />
To crown some chosen day, the choice reserve<br />
Where noble oaks their autumn tints display,<br />
And fern gigantic checks the sportsman&rsquo;s way<br />
But well is toil and trouble there repaid,<br />
By the wild tenants of that oaken shade,<br />
While rabbits, hares, successive, cross your road,<br />
And scarcely give the time to fire and load,&mdash;<br />
While shots resound, and pheasants loudly crow,<br />
Who heeds the bramble?&nbsp; Who fatigue can know?<br />
Here from the brake, that bird of stealthy flight,<br />
The mottled woodcock glads our eager sight,<br />
Great is his triumph, whose lucky shot shall kill<br />
The dark-eyed stranger of the lengthy bill<br />
Unlike the pheasant, who himself betrays,<br />
And dearly for his daring challenge pays.<br />
Small notice gives the woodcock of his flight;<br />
Not seen at once, at once he&rsquo;s lost to sight.<br />
Yet short his flight, and should you mark him down,<br />
The chances are that woodcock is your own;<br />
But quick the hand, and no less quick the eye,<br />
Would stop him as he hurries by;<br />
Few are the birds, whate&rsquo;er may be their sort,<br />
More try the skill, give more exciting sport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few words may be said on the pheasants and partridges; and
first of the former.&nbsp; The breed on the Ostler ground have a
history.&nbsp; The late Sir Henry Dymoke, of Scrivelsby Court,
used to rear, in large numbers, a white breed of pheasant, and
as, with the exception of the Ostler ground, he, with his
brother, had almost the whole of the shooting, extending from
Scrivelsby to the Witham, they spread over that ground, and
sought a kind of asylum in the dense cover of the Ostler
plantations.&nbsp; Further, the writer&rsquo;s father-in-law
imported an Indian breed, called the &ldquo;Kalege&rdquo;
pheasant, a very handsome bird; and these two strains have
affected the breed on that ground, and, doubtless, have also had
their effect on pheasants in the neighbourhood generally.&nbsp;
White broods of pheasants are from time to time hatched on the
ground; also piebald varieties are not uncommon.&nbsp; In the
year 1898, a cream-coloured specimen was shot.&nbsp; Some of the
cocks have at times a decided fringe of blue or purple in their
plumages from the Kalege mixture.</p>
<p>As to partridges: It is only in recent years that the French,
or red-legged breed (Cannabis rufa) have established themselves
here.&nbsp; In the sixties, though said to have been introduced
into England by Charles II., they were almost, if not entirely,
unknown here.&nbsp; The writer shot them in Cambridgeshire in the
fifties; and from the south-eastern coast and counties they have
persistently spread, until now we have them everywhere.&nbsp; In
the first instance, probably, they were brought across &ldquo;the
silver streak&rdquo; by a gale, like the sand grouse, of which we
have read, on the coast of Yorkshire.&nbsp; But whereas <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the
sand grouse were immediately shot as curiosities, the red-leg,
being a bird (as every shooter knows) given to running, knew how
to take care of himself, and, like many another unwelcome
intruder, he <i>came to stay</i>.&nbsp; The flesh is decidedly
inferior in flavour to that of the common English brown
partridge.&nbsp; I well remember a practical joke being played on
a Woodhall keeper.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Frenchmen,&rdquo; as they
were called, had only just arrived.&nbsp; A party of us were out
shooting, and a red-leg was shot.&nbsp; The keeper, seeing the
new and handsome-looking bird, was very proud of it, and though
he had never yet tasted one, he loudly proclaimed, in his
ignorance, that it would be as good in the eating as fine in the
plumage.&nbsp; A day or two after we were out shooting
again.&nbsp; Luncheon time came, and we lay stretched on the
sward under a spreading tree, on a hot day in September, where
the ladies joined us, bringing the refreshment.&nbsp; Cold
partridges were among the fare, and instructions had been given
beforehand that the &ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; should be specially
reserved, to hand to the keeper.&nbsp; In due course the Captain
passed on to the keeper&mdash;as being specially favoured
&ldquo;above his fellows,&rdquo; by the attention&mdash;half of a
partridge.&nbsp; Nothing was said, and we all busied ourselves
with the viands before us, but the keeper was under our careful
observation.&nbsp; Presently his features were seen to be
considerably distorted by wry faces, as he turned the leg or the
wing about in his hands, while picking them, with some
difficulty, to the bone.&nbsp; Probably the bird was not only a
&ldquo;Frenchman,&rdquo; but a tough old cock into the
bargain.&nbsp; At length he could stand it no longer, and,
looking round at us, he said, &ldquo;Dal it! Captain, but this
bird&rsquo;s a rum &rsquo;un.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
like it?&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s the
handsome Frenchman you admired so much, when it was shot the
other day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the
keeper, &ldquo;I wish all such Frenchmen were at the battle of
Water-gruel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll back the English.&rdquo; <a

<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>There are some rather curious facts in connection with
the brown English partridge and the French variety.&nbsp; Though
different in their habits, and, it is said, even hostile to each
other, they yet, in some instances, consort.&nbsp; I once shot on
the moor three brown and one red-leg, out of the same covey, all
young birds.&nbsp; They had evidently been reared together in one
brood, and the old birds were of the brown species.&nbsp;
Mentioning this to a friend of large experience, he told me that
he had known several instances where the eggs of the two kinds
had been found laid in the same nest.&nbsp; The eggs are, of
course, easily distinguishable, those of the common partridge
being of a greenish drab colour, while those of the red-leg are
of a dull, cream colour, covered with small brown spots.&nbsp; I
have been informed by another authority that the eggs of the
red-leg have also been found in the nest of an outlying pheasant.
<a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; A curious provision of nature,
conducing to the preservation of the species, may be here
mentioned as interesting; the partridge, while sitting on her
eggs, has no scent.&nbsp; On one occasion a man was consulting me
about a tombstone at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Woodhall.&nbsp;
We walked into the churchyard together, and stood conversing
opposite the grave in question.&nbsp; I was aware that a
partridge was sitting on her nest concealed in the grass between
that grave and the next, and therefore would not approach very
near.&nbsp; Suddenly I perceived that he had a terrier with him,
which was very busily hunting over the churchyard.&nbsp; I begged
him to keep it in.&nbsp; He was rather <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>indignant,
and replied that it could do no harm in the churchyard.&nbsp; I
remarked that he was not aware that within eight or ten feet of
us a partridge was on her nest, and I did not wish her to be
disturbed.&nbsp; He thereupon called in his dog, but that only
brought his dog nearer to the nest, hunting the while; and the
dog actually passed over the nest without scenting the bird. <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; The eggs were hatched the next
day, and that doubtless accounted for her sitting so
closely.&nbsp; Whether or not from an instinctive consciousness
of this safeguard is not for me to say, but the partridge is
rather given to selecting her nesting place near a highway or a
footpath.&nbsp; I have known several instances of this, and only
last year I repeatedly saw both the parent birds sitting on their
nest together, on a bank close to a public footpath which was
daily traversed.</p>
<p>To show how closely a partridge will continue to sit, under
very trying circumstances, I give here an anecdote of what
occurred in a parish adjoining Woodhall Spa, as it was related to
me by the chief witness, the Squire himself.</p>
<p>In a meadow adjoining Roughton Hall, a partridge made her nest
in a slight depression of the surface.&nbsp; The meadow was, in
due course, mown, the mower passing his scythe over her without
injuring her, and unaware of her presence, the depression having
still enough grass to conceal the nest.&nbsp; The field was
afterwards &ldquo;tedded,&rdquo; i.e., the grass was tossed about
by a machine, which again passed over the nest, still leaving her
unscathed and unmoved.&nbsp; In the process of
&ldquo;cocking,&rdquo; the field was next horse-raked, the rake
passing over the nest, with the same result.&nbsp; One of the
haymakers, however, nearly trod on the nest; this drove the bird
off, behind him, so that he did not observe it.&nbsp; But a
friend was near at hand.&nbsp; The squire, seeing the bird fly
away, went to the spot, found <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the hidden
nest, and counted in it the unusual number of 19 eggs (promise of
a good partridge season, weather permitting).&nbsp; He at once
removed to a distance all the hay lying near, to prevent her
being disturbed again, and watched the result.&nbsp; Within a
quarter of an hour the partridge quietly returned to her
nest.&nbsp; Ten days later she successfully brought off a brood
of seventeen, two bad eggs remaining in the nest.&nbsp; Of
course, as the hatching time draws near, the mother, feeling the
young lives under her, sits more persistently than at an earlier
period; but surely this mother partridge exhibited a remarkable
instance of fidelity to maternal instinct, after passing through
no less than four trying ordeals.</p>
<p>Of wild pigeons we have three kinds: the common woodpigeon or
ringdove, of which there are large flocks; the stockdoves, which
go in pairs, and (as their name implies) build their nest on a
solitary stump or tree, or occasionally in a rabbit hole.&nbsp;
The turtledove, though common in the south of England, is a
migratory bird, and in these parts not a constant visitor.&nbsp;
A &ldquo;wave&rdquo; of them spread over the Midland counties in
1895, and since that they have been seen in smaller
numbers.&nbsp; The late Mr. J. Cordeaux, F.R.G.S., M.B.O.U., one
of our greatest authorities, says that its note is lower and more
of a querulous murmur than that of the ringdove.&nbsp; In size it
is not much larger than a missel thrush.</p>
<p>The first of these pigeons is the bird named the
&ldquo;Culver,&rdquo; in old writings, as Spencer sings in
romantic ditty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Like as the culver, on the bared bough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sits mourning for the absence of her mate,<br />
And in her song breathes many a wistful vow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his return, who seems to linger late,<br />
So I, alone, now left disconsolate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mourn to myself the absence of my love,<br />
And sitting here, all desolate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek with my plaints to match that mournful
dove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of woodpeckers we have on the moor and in Bracken Wood at
times, three kinds: the common green species (picus viridis)
which is generally plentiful; the lesser spotted (picus minor),
not seen every year, but occasionally; and, still less frequently
seen, the larger spotted (picus major).&nbsp; Of the former of
these spotted kinds, seeing three together, I shot one a few
years ago; and the keeper shot another for me more recently, for
our Naturalists&rsquo; Museum at Lincoln.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;birds of prey,&rdquo; so called, the greatest
part are extinct, or nearly so, too often from a mistaken belief
in their destructiveness; <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>whereas they
are really useful allies of the farmer, if not also of the
sportsman.&nbsp; In the cause of the latter, they, for the most
part destroy (if they destroy game at all) the weakly members, so
conducing towards keeping up a vigorous breed, and for the farmer
they destroy smaller vermin, the mice which, but for them, would
multiply (as they have done in several places) until they become
a plague.&nbsp; In the year 1890, a very large bird was reported
as being seen about the woods near Woodhall, but I could not get
a sight of it myself, nor could I get anyone else to give a
description of it, except that it was very large.&nbsp; After a
time it disappeared from Woodhall, and was reported as being seen
for a time about Revesby, and on November 8th an eagle was shot
by the son of a farmer residing at Tupholme Hall, in a wood at
Southrey belonging to Mr. Vyner.&nbsp; It proved to be a male
bird, in good condition, measuring 6ft. 7in. across the wings,
and weighing 11lbs.&nbsp; I rode over to see it, but it had been
sent to the taxidermist to be stuffed.&nbsp; It was a sea eagle
(Haliactus albicilla).&nbsp; The kite (milvus ictinus) used to be
common 40 years ago; its presence being notified by our hens
cackling, and ducks quacking, as they called together their
broods, when they espied it soaring at a considerable height
above.&nbsp; If a reckless chick, or duckling, neglected to take
the warning, and seek shelter beneath the mother&rsquo;s wings,
there was for a moment a rushing sound, a general confusion in
the poultry yard, a half-smothered scream, and the kite flew away
with a victim in its claws. <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>I
have seen this more than once myself.&nbsp; The kite is now quite
extinct in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; The same may be said of the
buzzard (buteo vulgaris).&nbsp; Although their food was chiefly
mice and small birds; perhaps occasionally game, but not
generally; since, though a very fine bird in appearance, they
were not rapid enough on the wing to overtake the partridge in
full flight; yet the keepers waged war against them &ldquo;to the
knife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many is the buzzard I have seen nailed up
with the pole-cats and other vermin in the woods at
Woodhall.&nbsp; But they are now seen no more, and a handsome and
comparatively harmless ornament of our sylvan scenery is gone
beyond recall.</p>
<p>The Hen-Harrier (circus cyaneus), a more active bird than the
buzzard, is another of the &ldquo;Ichabods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its last
known nesting place was on the top of &ldquo;The Tower on the
Moor,&rdquo; near Woodhall.&nbsp; As a boy, the writer has
climbed that tower for the eggs, and he has now a very fine
specimen of the old bird stuffed, measuring about 40 inches
across, from tip to tip of the wings.&nbsp; These birds were wont
to fly at higher game than the buzzard, and doubtless did at
times destroy partridges; but they also fed largely on water-rats
and frogs, and were not above gorging themselves on
carrion.&nbsp; The female is larger than the male.</p>
<p>The beautiful little Merlin (Falco &AElig;salon) was also
seen, though not common, twenty-five or thirty years ago.&nbsp;
It was a very plucky little bird, and I have seen one strike down
a partridge larger in bulk than itself.&nbsp; This is gone, never
to return.</p>
<p>The Sparrow-Hawk (Accipiter fringillarius) survives, although
in diminished numbers; and this indeed is the only one of the
hawks against which &ldquo;my voice should be for open
war.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is very destructive and very daring in the
pursuit of its quarry.&nbsp; A connection of my own was sitting
in a room facing the garden at the Victoria Hotel, Woodhall, when
a sparrow-hawk dashed after its prey, broke the glass of the
window, and fell stunned on the floor of the room.&nbsp; The
female in this kind also is larger <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>than the
mate.&nbsp; This bird will kill young ducks and chickens, and
partridges, and even pheasants.</p>
<p>The Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) also still survives, and we do
not grudge it a prolonged lease of life.&nbsp; It feeds chiefly
upon mice and small birds, cockchafers, and other insects; is a
graceful object as it hangs lightly hovering at a considerable
height in the air; with its keen vision detects its small prey
half hidden in the grass or stubble, and then with lightning
rapidity, drops like a stone upon it, and bears it away.&nbsp; I
have kept kestrels and sparrow-hawks and tamed them; and the
former will become tractable and almost affectionate, but the
latter is a winged Ishmaelite, and very treacherous, and if
allowed a little liberty, it generally ends in his making his
escape. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a></p>
<p>Owls are still, I am glad to say, plentiful.&nbsp; They are
amongst the farmers&rsquo; greatest feathered friends, killing
enormous quantities of mice, which otherwise would damage his
crops. <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; We have three kinds on the moor
or in the woods: 1st&mdash;the barn owl, or screech owl (stryx
flammea); 2nd&mdash;the wood or brown owl (synnium aluco);
3rd&mdash;the horned-owl (asio otus).&nbsp; The two last are very
much alike in both size and colour, but the last has two tufts of
feathers rising on each aide of the head, from which it gets its
name of horned-owl.&nbsp; I have a note among my shooting
records: &ldquo;Dec. 5th, 1872, shot Bird Hag Wood, in Kirkstead,
put up about a dozen owls.&rdquo;&nbsp; These would be the
&ldquo;horned&rdquo; kind.&nbsp; Five were shot on that occasion,
but as a rule they have been carefully spared, one only
occasionally being killed as a specimen for stuffing.&nbsp;
Within the nineties, being out with my gun, on the moor, when the
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>ground was covered with snow, I passed by a solitary
thick Scotch fir, when an owl flew out.&nbsp; I wanted a specimen
for a friend who was staying with me, and I shot it.&nbsp; The
report created quite a commotion within the tree, and some twenty
owls were immediately flying about me.&nbsp; Not being likely to
settle in the snow, and apparently dazed by the glare of the sun
reflected from the snow, I left them as quickly as I could, to
recover their composure, and return to the sheltered quarters in
which they had congregated.&nbsp; Hunting, as they do, almost
entirely by night, they have little opportunity of interfering
with the game, nor is it their propensity to do so. <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; There are three very ancient
hollow oak trees in &ldquo;The Arbours&rdquo; Wood in
Kirkstead.&nbsp; These are a favourite resort of the barn
owl.</p>
<p>The carrion crow still nests on the moor, although the eggs
are taken every season.&nbsp; But the old birds are very wary,
and manage to keep out of shot.&nbsp; The common rook, however,
of late years, has got a bad name, as having taken up the
marauding habits of the genuine crow.&nbsp; Owing to the improved
cultivation of land, there is not now the supply of grubs on
which the rook used to feed, and they have taken to hunting for
the eggs of partridge and pheasant, and may be seen
&ldquo;quartering&rdquo; the ground as methodically as a pointer
or setter.&nbsp; They are strongly suspected of killing the young
as well as rifling the nests of eggs, and the Scotch keepers
complain of their depredations on the moors, among the young
grouse.</p>
<p>A writer in the &ldquo;Yorkshire Poet&rdquo; (of August 22,
1898) says that black game are decreasing in the Border counties,
as the rooks destroy the eggs.</p>
<p>This completes the list of the larger birds frequenting the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; As I write this chapter, a letter from an
old friend says that he well remembers the number of night-jars
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>which were to be heard &ldquo;churring&rdquo; about
Woodhall on a summer&rsquo;s evening.&nbsp; This bird
(caprimulgus Europ&oelig;us), locally called fern-owl, comes to
us about May.&nbsp; I have a note: &ldquo;May 23rd, 1873, the
first night-jar heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the daytime, the
visitor, walking quietly through the woodland paths near the
Victoria Hotel, may, if he has a keen eye, see the night-jar
lying flat upon the branch of an oak, hardly indeed perceptible,
owing to its colour being so near that of the brown bark.&nbsp;
Then, towards evening, it may be seen taking its short and
wonderfully rapid flights, and you may hear its bills snap
together as it catches the moths and cockchafers on which it
feeds.&nbsp; It breeds on the moor, the nest generally being laid
on the ground among the bracken; whence its name of
fern-owl.&nbsp; The old idea of its sucking the goat or cow, from
the former of which it gets its classical name caprimulgus (as
well as the English equivalent), is, of course, long since
exploded. <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; The churring note is seldom
heard except when it is at rest on a branch of a tree.</p>
<p>The brilliant little Kingfisher (Alcedo ispida), the most gay
in colour of all our birds, may still sometimes be seen, darting
about the only rivulet which we can boast of at Woodhall, and
which rejoices in the unattractive name of &ldquo;The
Sewer,&rdquo; <a name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a> although its water, welling up at its
source near Well Syke Wood, is beautifully clear and pure.&nbsp;
The occurrence, however, of the bird here is rare.&nbsp; An old
inhabitant of Kirkby assures me that it is not uncommon on the
river Bain, in that parish; and of late years, partly <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>through the writer&rsquo;s influence, it may be seen on
the rivers Bain or Waring, in the heart of Horncastle,
unmolested, and even fed, by the people.</p>
<p>The Grey Fly Catcher (Muscicapa Grisola) is fairly common on
our lawns, where it will sit quietly on a garden seat, or roller,
and thence take its short jerky flight after the flies.&nbsp; I
have known it to nest year after year, at the Vicarage, in a hole
in the wall, where an iron ventilator was broken.</p>
<p>The Wryneck (Yunx Torquilla) is a somewhat uncommon bird at
Woodhall, though a pretty one.&nbsp; For several years it also
frequented the Vicarage garden, sometimes four or five of them,
during the summer months.&nbsp; One year there were so many that
I shot one and had it stuffed, and I found that at the same time
a noble Marquis was having two stuffed, as being rather
rare.&nbsp; It is called in some parts of the country the
&ldquo;weet&rdquo; bird, from its peculiar note; other
authorities say that the note is represented by the words,
&ldquo;Peel, peel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Peep-peep.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
should myself say &ldquo;Snipe, snipe&rdquo; was nearer to the
sound, and a writer compares it to the sound of Punch, in the old
show of &ldquo;Punch and Judy,&rdquo; which I think comes nearer
to my own interpretation.&nbsp; The body of this bird is in
colour a mixture of grey and brown, but its tail and wings are
most beautifully marked with dark zig-zag bars, which make it
very handsome.&nbsp; In size it is between the blackbird and the
lark.&nbsp; Like the woodpecker, it has a very long tongue, which
is covered with a glutinous matter, and which it inserts into the
grass roots or tree bark, in search of its food. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>I give here a list of birds which I have stuffed, all of which
were killed in this neighbourhood:&mdash;Night-jar (Caprimulgus
Europ&oelig;us), wry <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>neck (Yunx Torquilla), buff blackbird
(Turdus merula), razorbill (Alca Torda), little auk (Mergulus
Alia), ruff (Machetes Pugnax), green sand piper (Totanus
Octaopus), snipe (Scolopax gallinago), water rail (Rallus
Aquaticus), golden plover (Charadrius Pluvialis), woodcock
(Scolopax Rusticola), large spotted wood pecker (Dendrocopus
Major), hawfinch (Coccothraustes Vulgaris), cuckoo (Cuculus
Canorus), jay (Garrulus Glandarius), French partridge (Cannabis
Rufa), turtledove (Turtur Auritus), horned owl (Asio Otus), hen
harrier (Circus Cyaneus), kestrel (Falco Tinnunculus), peregrine
falcon (Falco Peregrinus), piebald pheasant (phasianus
colchicus), buff pheasant, cormorant (phylacrocorax carbo), jay
(corvus glandarius), heron (ardea cinerea), horned owl (asio
otus).</p>
<p>In times gone by, never to return, the numbers and variety of
wild fowls frequenting the Witham, with its &ldquo;sykes and
meres,&rdquo; was something extraordinary.&nbsp; Charles Kingsley
doubtless wrote, if not of his own knowledge, yet, at furthest,
at second hand, when he gave the following description:
&ldquo;Grand it was, while dark green alders and pale green reeds
stretched for miles . . . where the coot clanked, and the bittern
boomed, and the sedgebird, not content with its own sweet song,
mocked the notes of all the birds around . . . far off upon the
silver mere would rise a puff of smoke from a punt, invisible
from its flatness.&nbsp; Then down the wind came the boom of the
great stanchion-gun; and after that another sound, louder as it
neared; a cry as of all the bells of Cambridge, and all the
hounds of Cottesmore; and overhead rushed and whirled the skeins
of terrified wildfowl, screaming, piping, clacking, croaking,
filling the air with the hoarse rattle of their wings; while,
clear above all, sounded the wild whistle of the curlew, and the
trumpet note of the wild swan.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Prose
Idylls,&rdquo; The Fens.</p>
<blockquote><p>The living clouds on clouds arose,<br />
Infinite wing!&nbsp; Till all the plume-dart air<br />
And rude resounding shore was one wild cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the swans, we may observe that not only did this bird, in
its wild state, frequent the Witham and the Fen waters, but the
swannery was a valuable possession.&nbsp; The Abbots of Bardney
and Kirkstead owned swanneries on the Witham.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ol.&rdquo; vol. xvi., p. 153).&nbsp; The swans
of various owners were distinguished by marks on the upper
mandible, and there were no less than 97 different swan marks on
the Witham.&nbsp; A rhyming list of the birds of the Witham is
given in Drayton&rsquo;s Polyolbion (song <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>25), too long
to quote here; suffice it to say that one parish alone, near
Boston, some 60 years ago, sent 30,000 wild fowl in a year to
London&mdash;(Thompson&rsquo;s History, Boston).&nbsp; The
bird&rsquo;s captured by net were dunlins, knots, ruffs, reeves,
red-shanks, lapwings, golden plovers, curlews, godwits,
etc.&nbsp; One fowler stated that he had so taken 24 dozen
lapwings in one day, and four dozen and nine at one
time.&mdash;Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds of Norfolk,&rdquo;
vol. i., p. 57.&nbsp; Other birds shot by the fowlers were
mallard, teal, widgeon, whimbrells, grebes of several kinds, and
the &ldquo;yelping&rdquo; avocet.&nbsp; A relative of the present
writer owned a decoy, where some 20,000 wild ducks were taken,
within his own recollection, in one season. <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>We now come to the last bird which I shall name in this
somewhat lengthy list; a goddess among birds, as someone has
almost literally called her, &ldquo;&oelig;mula divini suavissima
carminis ales&rdquo;; and the old Scotch poet, William Drummond,
of Hawthornden, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sweet artless songster! thou my mind dost raise<br
/>
To airs of spheres&mdash;yes, and to angels&rsquo; lays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while quaint old Isaac Walton says: &ldquo;She breathes such
sweet music from her little instrumental throat, that it might
make mankind to think that miracles are not yet
ceased.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nightingale was first heard in my own
garden, at the vicarage, Woodhall Spa, in the spring of
1876.&nbsp; Having heard it at Cambridge, in the South of
England, and also in Italy, I immediately recognised the note,
and at first was delighted at the arrival of this new visitor to
Woodhall Spa, who did not come needing the water, and complaining
of aches and pains, but <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to delight everyone with its rich
flood of song.&nbsp; And having thus found its way here, it has
further found the attractions of Woodhall so great that, although
favouring no other place in the neighbourhood, it has continued
its annual visits ever since, and has brought its kindred in
increasing numbers.&nbsp; But, although charmed at first with its
melody, the novelty wore off; and when, night after night, there
were three or four of these birds waking the echoes beneath my
bedroom window, trying in jealous rivalry each to outdo the other
in compassing the whole gamut, &ldquo;in the rich mazes of
sound,&rdquo; my admiration considerably abated, and I became
rather disposed to vote the performance a veritable surfeit of
song, to the utter banishment of much-needed slumber.&nbsp;
Before, however, I had arrived at this prosaic way of viewing the
&ldquo;Queen of Song,&rdquo; I composed in its honour the
following lines, with which I shall close this chapter on the
Birds of Woodhall:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TO THE NIGHTINGALE.<br />

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How from that tiny throat,<br />

52</span>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; DENIZENS OF THE WOODS, &amp;c.&nbsp;
QUADRUPEDS.</h2>
<p>It is the inevitable, if regretful, duty of the recorder of
the past to have to inscribe &ldquo;Obiit&rdquo; over the mention
of many an individual who comes under his notice, and this
applies to the four-footed animals, as well as to the birds and
the wild flowers, of Woodhall.&nbsp; Of some of the most
interesting, it must be said that they are gone, and their place
knoweth them no more.</p>
<p>The first I may mention is the Badger.&nbsp; This animal used
to be fairly common in these parts; whether it is now quite
extinct is difficult to say, because its nocturnal habits, and
very retiring disposition, prevent it coming much under the
observation of man.&nbsp; It is supposed still to harbour in the
rocks at Holbeck, some nine miles from Woodhall.&nbsp; A specimen
was captured at Woodhall about the year 1885, frequenting some
rabbit holes in a bank, at that time belonging to myself, and
within 100 yards of the present blacksmith&rsquo;s shop on the
Stixwould-road.&nbsp; Another was captured a few years before in
the adjoining parish of Martin, which I have stuffed.&nbsp; At an
earlier date one was taken by a man named Thomas Norris, at Well
Syke Wood, some two miles from Woodhall Spa.</p>
<p>About the year 1889 one was seen for some months in the
Northern Dar Wood, in Woodhall.&nbsp; The keeper, doubtless with
murderous intent, tried to find its burrow, but did not
succeed.&nbsp; It was not killed so far as is known, but
disappeared.&nbsp; Another was killed in June, 1898, at Mavis
Enderby.&nbsp; In 1903, two badgers were killed at Asgarby, and
one at Asterby in 1904.&nbsp; In 1899 our local pack of hounds,
the South Wold, ran a badger, instead of a fox, over several
fields, until he took to ground, and was afterwards killed by one
of the party, as he kept his head out of the hole.&nbsp; It
should hardly be a moot <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>point whether the extermination of
the badger is an advantage or not, although a good deal has been
written on both sides of the subject.&nbsp; Its skin makes the
&ldquo;sporran&rdquo; of the kilted Highlander, and its hair
makes our shaving brushes.&nbsp; Though it may be found
occasionally in an enlarged rabbit burrow, it is not there to
prey on the rabbit; for (as Major Fisher assures us in his
interesting work, &ldquo;Out-door Life in England,&rdquo; 1896)
its diet is mainly vegetarian, and what animal food it indulges
in is mice, frogs, an occasional hedgehog, with beetles, snails,
and worms; and especially it is very partial to the grubs of the
wasp.&nbsp; It is very cleanly in its habits; sometimes occupying
the same &ldquo;earth&rdquo; with the fox, to the great advantage
of the latter, as it clears away the putrid matter brought in by
Reynard, and so prevents his contracting the mange, to which he
is very liable, from his own untidy propensities. <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; Being thus not only
comparatively harmless, but also serviceable to the sportsman, it
is much to be regretted that continued war should be waged
against these creatures. <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp;
Unfortunately, old prejudices are but slowly overcome.&nbsp; By a
statute enacted in the 8th year of Queen Elizabeth, chap. 15, and
confirmed by subsequent statutes, provision was made for the
destruction of what were then deemed &ldquo;noysome foule and
vermine,&rdquo; and the price of 1s. was set on the head of every
&ldquo;fox and grey,&rdquo; i.e., badger.&nbsp; This act
continued in force down to 1863.&nbsp; But the old ideas
concerning the badger have been long exploded among those who
know anything of its habits.&nbsp; The badger, further, is the
only representative of the bear family in this country.&nbsp; A
scion of that race, whose bones are found in our fossiliferous
caverns, co-eval with the mammoth and prehistoric man, he, if any
of our existing animals, may boast of &ldquo;blue blood in his
veins.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nobleman, whose ancestry came over with
the conqueror, is a <i>parvenu</i> in comparison with him.&nbsp;
Surely the principle of <i>Noblesse oblige</i> <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>alone should
ensure for him a shelter in our woods and wastes. <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a></p>
<p>The next to be mentioned of our <i>fer&oelig;
n&aelig;tur&aelig;</i>, also the object of constant persecution,
and growing, consequently, rarer every year, is the Otter.&nbsp;
The parish of Thimbleby adjoins Woodhall Spa on the north,
indeed, a large slice of it is now included in the recently
created civil parish of Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; At the further end of
Thimbleby an otter was killed in the year 1898, at a water mill
on the river Bain, the miller erroneously supposing that it would
kill his ducks.&nbsp; Shortly before, another specimen had been
shot by a keeper on the same river, at Goulceby, its mate
fortunately escaping.&nbsp; Soon after, a young specimen was seen
several times disporting itself in the Horncastle Canal.&nbsp; It
there escaped the vigilance of many would-be assassins, and
gradually worked its way towards our neighbouring river, the
Witham; but there it fell a victim to a gunner, who descried it
in a drain near Tattershall Bridge, in Billinghay Fen.&nbsp;
Another specimen was afterwards shot among the dykes of Walcot
Dales, near the Witham, and still another in the neighbouring
parish of Martin, a few years ago.&nbsp; Here again this
persistent slaughter is much to be regretted.&nbsp; The otter is
not the enemy to the fisherman which it is too commonly supposed
to be.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Badminton Library,&rdquo; the
Honourable Geoffrey Hill says: &ldquo;People are beginning to
find that the otters kill and keep down the coarser fish,
especially the eels, which live on the spawn and fry of the
better sorts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. E. Daubney, writing from the banks
of the Dart, says: &ldquo;They eat frogs, rats, birds, fish,
<i>et id genus omne</i>, but of nothing are they more fond than
the eel; for this they will give up the finest and most fresh-run
salmon.&rdquo; <a name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a>&nbsp; In our own neighbourhood, in
1901, two young otters were shot on a farm at Sturton; they were
at a pond which abounded in eels, and had doubtless by the eels
been attracted from the river Bain, a mile distant, where they
could only get trout.&nbsp; <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>A naturalist,
who watched some otters at their home, night and day, for more
than two months, says that he only saw them take three trout; the
first fish taken was an eel, the second a chub, or roach.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Country Life,&rdquo; illustrated, Vol. VI., No. 134,
July, 1899.)&nbsp; Another authority <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a> states that the
stomach of one specimen examined &ldquo;was full of larv&aelig;
and earthworms&rdquo;; while a fourth writer <a
name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a> says, &ldquo;Otters will eat celery,
potatoes, young shoots from the hedges; and especially have they
a liking for the two first.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer has seen a
dead salmon lying on a Highland river bank with the shoulder
eaten away by the otter, their peculiar habit being to take only
this part, and never to return to the body again. <a
name="citation55c"></a><a href="#footnote55c"
class="citation">[55c]</a>&nbsp; But even their attacks on the
salmon have indirectly a useful effect, for, as one of the
authorities already quoted (Mr. E. Daubney) observes: &ldquo;If a
salmon pool is visited by otters, the salmon are hustled, and so
made to bestir themselves (often when sickly, and reluctant to
move), and so make the effort to get down to the sea, to return
again enormously increased in size and condition, and in this way
the otter does the sportsman a service in sending the salmon down
to recruit in the sea; just as, in turn, the sea-lice which fix
upon the salmon when recruited in the salt water, so harass the
fish, as to drive it once more up the river again into the fresh
water, when it may afford sport to the angler.&rdquo; <a
name="citation55d"></a><a href="#footnote55d"
class="citation">[55d]</a>&nbsp; It is not generally known, and
it has even escaped the notice of our greatest naturalists, that
the otter utters a shrill whistle when calling to its mate or
young, which might be easily mistaken for the note of the
kingfisher or sand-piper.&nbsp; This has been noticed by Mr. F.
B. Whitlock, in the &ldquo;Naturalist&rdquo; for 1895, p.
381.&nbsp; The great stronghold of the otter is the broads of
Norfolk, where, in the sluggish, reedy water, he can get <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>plenty of eels, snails, and so forth.&nbsp; In our own
neighbourhood, if the war and extirpation goes on, he will soon
be a memory only.</p>
<p>The next wild animal to be named as fairly common at Woodhall
is the Fox.&nbsp; The locality, indeed, has been for many years a
stronghold <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a> of Reynard, as was to be expected, in a
district where the woods are so extensive, although by no means
so extensive as they were within the writer&rsquo;s
recollection.&nbsp; On one occasion, some 14 or 15 years ago, we
had the Burton hounds, and the South Wold, over the same ground,
in the same morning, within hearing, if not within sight, of each
other.&nbsp; The Ostler Ground, especially from the thick and
warm cover afforded by the heather, may be said to be a nursery
for foxes for the supply of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Not long ago
there were six earths; and there are still three, which are
carefully preserved; and the bark of the dog-fox or the answering
scream of the vixen may be heard almost any night, in different
directions, while out foraging.&nbsp; So thick is the cover, in
parts, that the hounds frequently fail to penetrate it; and,
after the pack have gone away without a find, I have almost
trodden upon a fox, on one occasion upon a brace of them, still
lying snugly among the &ldquo;ling&rdquo; in security.&nbsp; The
fox does much less harm than is commonly supposed.&nbsp; It will
not disturb other game if it can get rabbits, and it will not
take rabbits if it can get rats.&nbsp; A very old sporting farmer
has repeatedly assured me that although he had a rabbit warren
near his farmstead, the rabbits were left undisturbed, and even
his chickens were safe, so long as there were rats to be captured
in his corn-stacks, or in the banks about his farm-buildings. <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>The first fox
which the writer ever saw, was brought by a Woodhall man, named
Hare, to his father.&nbsp; It had been caught in a trap by the
leg, and had attempted to bite its own foot off, in order to
effect its escape.&nbsp; It was kept until the injured limb had
recovered, and was then sent to his friend, the M.F.H.&nbsp; The
writer&rsquo;s own recollections of fox-hunting go back to the
days of the famous Jack Musters, the Squire of Colwick and
Annesley, who married Mary Chaworth, the object of Lord
Byron&rsquo;s passionate admiration.&nbsp; Sometime in the
forties he hunted our own South Wold country.&nbsp; He was indeed
&ldquo;a character.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though said by the Prince Regent
to be &ldquo;the most perfect gentleman he had ever met,&rdquo;
yet, in the hunting field, his language and his actions were most
violent.&nbsp; The writer has still clearly impressed on his
memory an occasion at Woodhall, when, as a boy of 12 years old,
mounted on a small pony, and with the hounds running hard, he
endeavoured to open a gate for the impatient M.F.H., and, on his
not being able to accomplish this quickly enough, he was assailed
with such a flood of invective, and torrent of oaths, that he was
forced to withdraw from the attempt in confusion and
bewilderment.&nbsp; But, if the sportsman who crossed his path
was not spared by &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; as he was familiarly
called, neither was any unfortunate hound which offended
him.&nbsp; On one occasion, a young hound, at High-hall Wood,
near Woodhall, was guilty of chasing a hare.&nbsp; The whole
&ldquo;field&rdquo; was in consequence pulled up; one of the
whips was ordered to bring the delinquent forward.&nbsp; The
thong of his hunting crop was twisted round the hound&rsquo;s
neck, and while he on foot held the poor brute in this way, the
other whip dismounted and belaboured it with his whip until he
was himself too exhausted to flog any more.&nbsp; The whole field
were kept looking on at this display of wholesome (?) discipline,
and when it was over the hound was left lying on the ground,
almost strangled and a mass of contused weals, to recover its
consciousness and limp after the departing pack, as best it
could.&nbsp; The painful impression made upon the young mind of
one devoted to animals, and tender of their feelings, remains
still as an unpleasant memory, from which it recoils.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>At one of our meets, a fox was found in Bracken Wood,
which, after giving us a good run round the neighbourhood,
eventually took refuge in a cottage near High-hall Wood.&nbsp;
Entering by the open door, it mounted the ladder which formed the
staircase to the one bedroom above; there it crept under the
bed.&nbsp; The hounds hunted all round the premises, but the door
having been shut by the occupier, an aged, retired keeper, and
there being a strong wind which blew the scent from the door, his
retreat was not discovered.&nbsp; He remained in this place of
concealment until the hounds had gone to a safe distance, and
then, descending by the ladder, bolted out of the door and made
off, verifying the adage of Erasmus (older than
&ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo;),</p>
<blockquote><p>That same that runnith a awaie<br />
Againe maie fighte ane other daie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The well-known cunning of the fox is shewn in the
following:&mdash;A favourite &ldquo;find&rdquo; for many yeans
has been Thornton Wood, some three miles from Woodhall Spa; and a
frequent line for the fox to take was (and is) from that covert
to Holme Wood, near Scrivelsby.&nbsp; To accomplish this the
Horncastle Canal and the small river Bain have to be
crossed.&nbsp; The writer, as a boy, has swum the canal on his
pony, at the tail of the pack; but usually riders have to make a
detour by a bridge, between the first and second locks on the
canal.&nbsp; During the intervals of ten minutes or a quarter of
an hour required for this, the hounds are left to
themselves.&nbsp; It happened on two or three occasions that in
this interval the scent suddenly failed, and the fox was lost;
casts were made up and down the river, but without success.&nbsp;
On one occasion, a labourer, working in the grass field between
the canal and the Bain, saw the fox cross the canal by the lock
doors, over which there was a narrow plank-bridge for
foot-passengers.&nbsp; It then made across the field for the
Bain.&nbsp; He saw it pass out of sight down the banks of the
river, close by a willow tree, overhanging the water; but it did
not emerge on the other side.&nbsp; With the lack of quick wit,
characteristic of the clod-hopper, it did not occur to him to
mention this at the time.&nbsp; He told it, however, afterwards
to his master, a hunting man; and, on a subsequent occasion, when
the same incident occurred again, one of the whips dismounted and
went into the water, and, poking about the roots of the willows,
dislodged Reynard, concealed under the hollow bank, and immersed
under water, except his nose and mouth, by which he was hanging
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>suspended from a fang of the tree roots.&nbsp; Surely
Reynard&rsquo;s clever ruse deserved a better fate than the death
which speedily followed.</p>
<p>The following incident occurred under my own
observation.&nbsp; I was out shooting in Woodhall.&nbsp; In a
certain field I had put up a hare, which went away, without a
shot.&nbsp; Passing, in due course, to the next field, I observed
an object sitting, so far as I could make out, in a crouching
position, in the middle of the field, and it looked in the
distance like a man.&nbsp; I proceeded towards it, and soon
perceived that it was a fox, sitting up on his
hindquarters.&nbsp; At this moment a hare, presumably that which
I had put up just before, entered the field and cantered
leisurely in the direction of the fox.&nbsp; As sportsmen are
aware, the hare, though able to see behind it, or on either side,
does not, from the peculiar position of the eyes, see so well
straight in front.&nbsp; In this case, the hare never perceived
the fox until it was within a few feet of it; whereupon it
stopped short, and the two sat up facing each other, evidently
mutually fascinated, as the bird is said to be by the
snake.&nbsp; They thus remained motionless, or powerless to move,
for some minutes, until my nearer approach attracted their
attention and broke the spell, whereupon they both bounded off in
different directions.&nbsp; This, I am told by an authority, was
a case of neurasthenia, or nerve-paralysis.&nbsp; A not quite
similar occurrence was recorded some little time ago.&nbsp; A
farmer saw a pheasant go to roost in a tree, standing alone in
the field.&nbsp; Presently he saw a fox approach, go to the tree,
and look up at the pheasant.&nbsp; After pausing for a moment,
regarding the bird, he proceeded to run rapidly round the tree in
a narrow circle.&nbsp; This he did for some time, continuing his
circuit without intermission; when, to the farmer&rsquo;s
astonishment, the pheasant fell from its roost, and before it
reached the ground was seized by the fox, who went off with his
prey to a neighbouring plantation.&nbsp; This would seem to have
been a case of hypnotism, rather than neurasthenia.&nbsp; The
bird was mesmerised, or made giddy, by the fox&rsquo;s circular
motion, and literally fell into the operator&rsquo;s
arms.&mdash;(&ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; January, 1898).&nbsp; The
writer, when travelling in Germany, once met a German gentleman,
who had visited country houses in England, and had conceived a
great admiration for the English sport of fox-hunting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have nothing like it in
Germany.&nbsp; It is a grand institution.&nbsp; It makes you good
horsemen, good soldiers, good judges of country and
distance.&rdquo;&nbsp; To those who <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>would object
to fox-hunting on the score of its cruelty, I would quote words
used at a church congress, by Colonel Hornby, master of the Devon
and Somerset Staghounds.&nbsp; Speaking on &ldquo;The Ethics of
Amusements,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;The exercise of hunting is
productive of the most beneficial effects on both mind and
body.&nbsp; There could be no hunting without suffering to the
animal hunted, but this was greatly exaggerated.&nbsp; These
animals were born to be hunted by other wild animals; we had
destroyed the latter, and our hunting was more merciful.&nbsp;
The pain inflicted was no equivalent to the pleasure afforded to
hounds and horses, leaving men out of the question.&nbsp; The
true lover of sport was a lover of mercy as well.&nbsp; Every
sportsman, in the true sense of the word, did all in his power to
lessen the suffering.&rdquo;&mdash;Quoted,
&ldquo;Guardian,&rdquo; Oct. 17, 1894, p. 1,620.</p>
<p>The days are gone by when gentlemen &ldquo;of the cloth&rdquo;
were common in the hunting field.&nbsp; Yet I have known some of
the hardest working clergymen, and the most sincere, earnest
Christians, who saw no excessive cruelty in the chase.&nbsp; We
have no &ldquo;Jack Russels&rdquo; among us now; the last of the
type who lived in our neighbourhood found a dead fox in his
pulpit, when he ascended it to preach his sermon one Sunday
morning; and though he did not deliver a funeral oration over it,
it was said that he buried it with as much loving reverence and
genuine grief, as if it had been a Christian parishioner.</p>
<p>A meet of the foxhounds at that favourite tryst, the
&ldquo;Tower on the Moor,&rdquo; near to Woodhall Spa, presents a
pretty and lively scene.&nbsp; Besides the red-coated sportsman,
there are riders, with horses of every degree, from the
barebacked, or rudely saddled &ldquo;screw,&rdquo; to the 100
guinea or 200 guinea hunter; and from the &ldquo;weedy&rdquo;
hack to the long, elastic-legged animal of racing blood.&nbsp;
There are numerous vehicles, two-wheeled and four-wheeled, with
their varied occupants, from the butcher&rsquo;s light cart to
the phaeton or the drag.&nbsp; There are numbers on foot, of both
sexes; some of the men, staid of mein and beyond middle life,
have already walked their miles; townsmen, for once, breaking
away from their trade, or their business, and bent once more on
breathing the fresh air on the heather, and listening again to
the &ldquo;echoing horn,&rdquo; as it vibrates through the
woods.&nbsp; There are ladies, on horseback, eager for the burst
across country &ldquo;in the first flight&rdquo;; there are
ladies on cycles, not yet arrived at the <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>degree of
perfection to enable the fair riders to take a
&ldquo;bee-line,&rdquo; but yet, from the speed attainable, able
to make rapid detours, and if they study the wind, and are
familiar with the &ldquo;lay&rdquo; of the country, likely to see
almost as much of the sport as the best-mounted.&nbsp; All are
bent on the healthy enjoyment of this thoroughly English
pastime.&nbsp; Their thoughts might find echo in the old hunting
song,</p>
<blockquote><p>Tally-ho!&nbsp; Tally-ho!<br />
Let the foreigner know<br />
We are Englishmen: so,<br />
Tally-ho!&nbsp; Tally-ho!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And who shall say that the pleasure is confined to them?&nbsp;
Someone has said: &ldquo;The horses enjoy it, the hounds enjoy
it, and no one can say from experience that the fox does not
enjoy it as well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes the M.F.H., with his
beauties, all in &ldquo;the pink&rdquo; of condition.&nbsp; A
moment&rsquo;s delay for pleasant greetings between all and
sundry, and the hounds are quickly thrown in for business; their
tails, and little more, wave above the long ling and the tall
bracken.&nbsp; The whips gallop to their points of
observation.&nbsp; Presently a whimper or two is heard; then the
deeper tone of an old hound takes it up; the rest rally about
him, and soon the whole pack join in full chorus.&nbsp; A halloo
is heard from a ride, as the fox crosses it; a distant hat is
held up to show the line he is taking in the cover, and then a
more distant shout of &ldquo;gone away,&rdquo; and the whole
field are off, helter skelter, as though riding for their lives,
<i>sauve qui peut</i>.&nbsp; Such are &ldquo;the pleasures of the
chase,&rdquo; for which we are indebted to the Little Red Rover:
&ldquo;The sport of kings, the image of war, without its
guilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Somerville, &ldquo;The Chase,&rdquo; Book
I.)</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Woodhall combines lands of a wild
unreclaimed nature, such as the Ostler Ground and other
moorlands, in the parishes of Thornton, Martin, Roughton, Kirkby
and Tattershall, and closely contiguous, and even mixed up with
these, lands which are in an advanced state of cultivation.&nbsp;
I have already mentioned a tract of waste, boggy ground, lying
between the Tower on the Moor and Bracken Wood, formerly the
haunt of wild fowl, and still called &ldquo;The Bogs
Neuk.&rdquo;&nbsp; The origin of this ground was probably the
following:&mdash;The old antiquary, Leland, writing of &ldquo;The
Tower,&rdquo; <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a> says, &ldquo;one of the Cromwelles
builded a pretty turret, caullid the Tower on the Moore, and <!--
page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>thereby he made a faire greate pond or lake, bricked
about.&nbsp; The lake is commonly called the
Synkker.&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;lake,&rdquo; and all trace of
it, have entirely disappeared; but it is probable that the decay
of its &ldquo;bricked&rdquo; walls, or of whatever the
environment may really have been, led to the escape of the water,
and the creation of the tract of swamp, which remained until
recent years.&nbsp; Similarly the Ostler Ground was, within the
writer&rsquo;s recollection, a much wilder tract, and its woods
more extensive than at present.&nbsp; Some 300 acres of wood were
destroyed by fire, through accident, about the year 1847.&nbsp;
This happened at night, and, seen from a distance, it looked like
a vast American prairie conflagration, the heavens being tinged
with a lurid light far and wide.&nbsp; At that time the
plantations opposite the Tower were of Scotch fir, so dense that
the rays of the sun could scarcely penetrate.&nbsp; The roads, as
I have previously stated, were little more than cart tracts,
often shifting; and the whole tract was almost as little
frequented, or disturbed, as if it had been in the heart of the
Black Forest of Germany.&nbsp; In the centre of this wild were
two or three fields belonging to another property, <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a> where roamed a herd of small, shaggy
cattle, which, shut out as they were from the rest of the world,
became almost wild; and when, on occasions, the foxhounds
penetrated to their haunts, they frantically broke through all
bounds, and for some days afterwards would be found scattered
about the open country around.&nbsp; This tract of wood and moor
has been for many years the prettiest bit of wild shooting
anywhere in this neighbourhood for many miles round.&nbsp; There
is not, at the present time, anything like the amount of game
upon it which was to be found only a few years ago; drainage and
several very dry seasons, as also two or three accidental fires,
having killed much of the ling, and reduced very considerably the
amount of cover.&nbsp; Still, to the genuine sportsman who thinks
more of a varied bag than of the slaughter of numbers, it affords
great attractions, and the writer has enjoyed many a happy day of
healthy relaxation, with dog and gun, upon it. <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; The <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>variety of
birds now, or formerly, to be seen, have been described
already.&nbsp; The ground game upon it now, apart from the fox,
are the hares and rabbits; of these I shall speak more at length
presently.&nbsp; If the Moor ground has afforded fair sport of a
wild and varied character, the shooting in the adjoining domain
of Kirkstead, in hares and partridges, has been also much
superior to the rest of the neighbourhood, with the one exception
of Tattershall, which has been nearly as good.&nbsp; On one
occasion, being one of a party of five, the writer was stationed
at the north-east corner of &ldquo;The Arbours Wood,&rdquo; in
Kirkstead, to shoot the hares which passed that point, while the
rest of the sportsmen walked the wood with the beaters.&nbsp; In
the space of about one hour and a quarter, without moving from
his position, he shot 56 hares.&nbsp; At one moment he had 16
hares lying dead before him; and he could have shot many more,
but that, from the rapid firing, his gun barrels became, at
times, so hot that he was afraid to load, and the hares were
allowed to pass him, and escape unmolested. <a

<p>We occasionally find on the Ostler Ground an unusual hybrid
between hare and rabbit, a notice of which may be of some
interest to the naturalist.&nbsp; As its occurrence has led to a
good deal of correspondence, I will give here a summary of the
observations made upon it as they were stated by me at a meeting
of the Lincolnshire Naturalists&rsquo; Union.&nbsp; Among other
persons who made enquiry about it was Mr. Walter Heape, of
Cambridge, who has made <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the subject of hybrids a special
study.&nbsp; He asked my reasons for supposing the animal to be
such a cross.&nbsp; My reply was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The animal is the size of a hare.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Its fur is the rabbit grey.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; The head is the shorter, and the ears the more
pricked and shorter, of the rabbit.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; One which I shot at, and missed in the ling, bolted
straight for a hole, as though accustomed to it, and I never knew
a hare to go to ground in that ready way.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; A tradition has long attached to the Moor that the
hare and rabbit do occasionally inter-breed.</p>
<p>Mr. Heape replied:&mdash;&ldquo;I am aware that many
naturalists deny that hares and rabbits will breed
together.&nbsp; I am not, however, myself of that opinion, but I
never had satisfactory proof of such a cross
occurring.&rdquo;&nbsp; Further enquiry led to the following
facts:&mdash;In the year 1773 the Abbe Domenico Gagliari got two
litters from a female hare by a male rabbit.&nbsp; Richard
Thursfield also got hybrid&rsquo;s of these two species.&nbsp; M.
Roux, in 1847, established a breed of &ldquo;Leporides&rdquo; in
Angonleme, where he bred largely hybrids of hares and rabbits,
and these hybrids were fertile with both parent species and among
themselves.&nbsp; Baron de Gleichen states that at Hoching,
Canton de la Prusse, Polonaise, hybrids of hare (female), and
rabbits (male) are generally known.&nbsp; He says, however, that
M. Brocca, the French savant, states that there are anatomical
differences between hare and rabbit which make it, antecedently,
improbable that they should inter-breed.&nbsp; I have myself shot
three of these hybrids on the Ostler Ground, and have one of them
stuffed.&nbsp; In the year 1897 Sir Henry Hawley shot a similar
specimen in Haltham Wood, some five miles from Woodhall; more
recently (Oct. 4th, 1898), the Rev. C. E. Chapman, then rector of
Scrivelsby, shot another in New York Fen; one was occasionally
seen on the Ostler Ground in 1898, and one was mentioned in
&ldquo;Land and Water,&rdquo; March 5, 1892, as having been shot
on the Moors, at Parkend, in Northumberland.&nbsp; I may add that
a cross between a rabbit and guinea pig is in the possession of a
person at Horncastle; and I have lately heard of a cross between
black game and the capercailzie in Scotland.&nbsp; But the
following somewhat analogous cases have created special
interest.&nbsp; Professor Ewart, of Edinburgh, has bred a cross
between a male Berchell&rsquo;s zebra and a mare pony, of the
Isle of Rum breed, half wild, lent for the <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>experiment by
Lord Arthur Cecil.&nbsp; The pony was jet black; the foal
resulting, except over the hind quarters, had as many stripes as
the zebra sire, the stripes being fawn colour, with background
nearly black.&nbsp; In form it closely resembled a well-bred
foal.&nbsp; As another interesting case of a similar kind, Lord
Morton has bred a cross between a male quagga and a nearly
pure-bred Arab mare; and Lord Tankerville has, more than once,
bred a cross between the famous wild Chillingham bull (Bos Urus
Primigenius) and a shorthorn cow.</p>
<p>An interesting variety of the hare is also found in Woodhall
and the neighbourhood.&nbsp; This is the albino or white
hare.&nbsp; Some 30 or more years ago one was frequently seen in
the parishes of Langton and Woodhall, and eventually was shot in
Thimbleby.&nbsp; They were then, so far as the writer knows, in
abeyance for some years.&nbsp; But within the last decade
heredity has asserted itself, and they have reappeared in
increased numbers, and would doubtless become an established
variety if allowed to multiply.&nbsp; In September, 1894, one of
the Woodhall tenants killed, in the harvest field, a
three-quarter-grown white leveret.&nbsp; In 1896 the writer
presented to the Natural History Museum, at Lincoln, a fine
albino specimen, also shot in Woodhall, with two small white
leverets, accidentally killed in the harvest field at
Langton.&nbsp; Since then, attention having been drawn to their
existence, a number of instances occurring in the neighbourhood
have been recorded.&nbsp; One was shot at Ranby as far back as
Oct. 19, 1860; two were seen in Clayworth in 1896; one was shot
in Baumber, Sept. 17, 1896; one shot at Thorpe Tilney, in
Timberland parish, with slight tinge of brown on the ears,
October, 1897; one shot in Timberland in 1895; one being seen
still at large in Thorne Tilney in May, 1898; one shot in
Branston, September, 1895, half grown; two shot at Bracebridge in
1893 or 1894; one shot in Wispington in 1896. <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; On one occasion, when <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>shooting in Kirkstead, the writer shot (right and left)
a couple of hares with white face and forelegs, one of which he
has stuffed.</p>
<p>We commonly speak of the cunning of the fox, but Mr. E. A.
Pease, M.P., in his recent book, &ldquo;Hunting
Reminiscences&rdquo; (Thacker &amp; Co., 1895, p. 119), says:
&ldquo;The hare is really a much more rus&eacute; animal than the
fox; can steal better away, and, once started, there is no end to
her wiles and dodges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this cunning, with a view
to self-preservation, I can give instances.&nbsp; It has been
maintained that hares never take to water, but a correspondence
was carried on in the newspaper a few years ago (see
&ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; Nov. 14, 1892), in which instances
were given of their doing so.&nbsp; I have myself seen a hare,
which has eluded the greyhounds, swim across a moat, almost
surrounding the house in which I am writing; and then steal away
to the cover of some large ferns in a sheltered nook in the
garden.&nbsp; Some years ago a baronet visited a relative of mine
in this neighborhood, and brought with him a pack of
beagles.&nbsp; We used to run on foot after these in pursuit of
hares.&nbsp; It is known that a hare, when getting exhausted, has
not the strong scent of one just started.&nbsp; As we ran over a
rough ploughed field, I have seen a hare, when nearly tired out,
thrust another sitting hare out of her &ldquo;form,&rdquo; and
take her place.&nbsp; The pack of beagles passed over the
worn-out hare squatting in the furrow, and rushed forward with a
fresh burst of music in their rich deep tones, on the strong
scent of the hare just set on foot.&nbsp; I passed the squatting
hare, but had not the heart to betray her, feeling that she
deserved to reap the reward of her cleverness.&nbsp; When hunted
by harriers, hares often &ldquo;double&rdquo; on their track, and
so throw the hounds out.&nbsp; I here give a very clever instance
of this, which I myself once witnessed.&nbsp; On one occasion,
sitting on the South Downs, watching the movements of a pack of
harriers in the distance, I saw &ldquo;puss&rdquo; gradually
approaching me.&nbsp; In a hilly country like the Downs, a hare,
from the great length and propelling power of her hind legs,
gains considerably upon the pack in running up hill, and loses
ground in a descent.&nbsp; The hare in question had just <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>descended a steep Down side, the hounds gaining rapidly
upon her.&nbsp; It was what may be termed &ldquo;a squeak&rdquo;
for her life, when, in the &ldquo;dean&rdquo; below, <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> she reached, just in time, the shelter
of a clump of gorse.&nbsp; Working her way through this, she
stole out on the opposite side to the pack, and at a tremendous
pace faced the hill, near the top of which I was sitting, by a
chalk quarry.&nbsp; In the ascent she distanced the hounds once
more, but she was getting done, and, in the gentle breeze which
floated towards me, I distinctly heard her panting as she bounded
upward.&nbsp; But here her instinctive cunning came into
play.&nbsp; The hill top was a few feet above me, some twenty
yards away.&nbsp; I sat motionless, and, in her anxiety about her
pursuers, she never observed me.&nbsp; She passed me, breathing
heavily, and sprang along as far as the hill top; there, just at
the brow, she paused, then cantered forward a few yards,
returned, and repeated this more than once.&nbsp; Then, turning
suddenly towards me, she made four or five huge bounds, only just
touching the ground, and dropped into the chalk quarry a few feet
below me, and crept under the shelter of some dwarf thorn
bushes.&nbsp; Her object was manifest.&nbsp; By passing more than
once over her own tracks, on the hill top, she created a strong
scent, which the breeze, just catching it at the brow, would
carry further forward.&nbsp; By her leaps towards the quarry, she
had left but a slight scent, and under those thorn bushes she was
doubtless waiting tremblingly the result of her ruse.&nbsp; I
remained motionless, watching the issue.&nbsp; The pack came
somewhat laboriously up the hill side, keeping close to the line
she had taken; and a pretty sight it was, as a large sheet would
almost have covered them, as they held on compactly
together.&nbsp; They passed, as the hare had done, within a few
yards of the chalk quarry; pressed on to the brow of the hill,
and thence followed the scent which had been blown on beyond
it.&nbsp; Presently there was a check, and the music
ceased.&nbsp; The master never thought of &ldquo;harking
back,&rdquo; his pack having followed a strong scent beyond the
brow; but pushed on to a spinney lying on the slope of the next
&ldquo;dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; I sat for a time longer by the quarry,
and presently I saw puss, having recovered her breath, emerge
from her hiding place and steal away, bent, doubtless, on
reaching some distant secure retreat before her limbs became
stiff from the unwonted exertion.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>I have known a hare, when hard pressed by the harriers,
enter a tunnel under a field gateway; but here instinct rather
fails her; for, too often, it is only avoiding one mode of death
by courting another.&nbsp; If there is water in the ditch,
running through the tunnel, the obstruction caused by her body
makes the water rise, and she is drowned; or, if she stays any
time in the tunnel, her cramped limbs get so stiff after her
exertions, that she cannot get out.</p>
<p>There is one kind of foe which the hare finds more difficult
to shake off, or elude, than a pack of harriers or beagles.&nbsp;
Stoats, foumarts, polecats, <i>et id genus omne</i>, are becoming
scarcer every year; although the writer was recently told of a
marten-cat&mdash;probably the Pine-marten (martes
abietum)&mdash;being killed in a tree, and sold for 10s. as a
rarity.&nbsp; I was a witness of the following:&mdash;Walking, in
the small hours of the morning, in a parish contiguous to
Woodhall, on my way to a stream where I was going to fish, I saw
a hare in a field adjoining the road, which was leaping about in
a most extraordinary fashion, starting hither and thither,
plunging into the rushes, springing into the air, and performing
all sorts of strange antics, which I could only account for, had
she been &ldquo;as mad as a March hare,&rdquo; as the saying is;
but this was in the month of May.&nbsp; Presently she rushed
forward, occasionally leaping into the air, towards the fence
which separated me from the fields.&nbsp; I expected to see her
appear through the hedge, in front of me; but she did not
come.&nbsp; Out of curiosity I got over the fence, when I saw the
hare lying, a few yards further on, stretched out as though
dead.&nbsp; I went up to her, and found that she was, indeed,
quite dead; and fast on her neck was a weasel, so gorged with her
blood, that its usually slender body was quite bloated.&nbsp;
Following the proverbial national instinct, I killed the weasel;
carried the hare to a footpath, and left it there, that some
labourer passing by might take it home to regale his family.</p>
<p>This incident leads me to speak of the pertinacity of our
weasels in hunting their prey, say a hare, as above, or a
rabbit.&nbsp; On one occasion, as I was riding by the side of a
strip of low whinbushes and long grass, a rabbit rushed out just
in front of me, its fur apparently curled with perspiration,
uttering a kind of suppressed cry, and evidently in a state of
the greatest terror.&nbsp; I pulled up in order to discover the
cause of this alarm.&nbsp; The rabbit re-entered the cover a few
yards further on; but presently, <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>where it had
emerged, I saw a weasel; and then I became aware that a number of
these creatures were working through the grass.&nbsp; I watched
their movements, following them at a distance, till they had
about reached the spot where the rabbit re-entered.&nbsp; Then,
feeling a keen sympathy for the poor persecuted rabbit, I charged
into the midst of the pack, and by dint of plunging up and down
among the startled company, and striking at them with my whip, I
succeeded in dispersing them.&nbsp; At the same moment the
rabbit, which had no doubt been crouching near, half paralysed
with fear, darted out, and passing by me, went away at a great
pace, as if rejoicing in the rescue.&nbsp; I pursued the weasels
for some distance, and should say there was not less than a
dozen.&nbsp; I was much astonished at the enormous leaps which
they made in their flight, their long, lithe bodies contracting,
and then expanding with a sudden jerk which threw them forward
several feet at a time.&nbsp; As to the habit of weasels hunting
in a pack, Waterton, the naturalist, mentions that he has seen
two old stoats with five half-grown young ones hunting together.
<a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"
class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; Richard Jefferies, in his book,
&ldquo;Round about a Great Estate,&rdquo; mentions having seen a
pack of five stoats hunting in company, and says that a poacher
told him that he had seen as many as fourteen so engaged.&nbsp;
In the above case, which came under my own observation, the
weasels were all apparently full grown and equally agile.</p>

70</span>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; REPTILES, FISHES, INSECTS.</h2>
<p>Walking along the path through the wood, from the cross roads,
near St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, towards the Victoria Hotel, the
writer, on one occasion, observed a lady poking with her parasol
at some object lying on the ground close to her feet.&nbsp; On
coming to the spot he found that she was playing with an adder,
which had crossed her path, apparently quite innocent of the
danger she was incurring, the serpent still, evidently, having
some attractive power for this, too curious daughter of
Eve.&nbsp; He at once, by a blow on the head with his walking
stick, despatched it, and then explained to her that it was lucky
for her that it had not bitten her on the ankle.&nbsp; The adder
or viper (Vipera Berus) is, fortunately, not common about
Woodhall, but it exists there, and may be seen at times, basking
on a sunny bank, or lying among the dead and dry foliage near a
path, or on the open heath, where the unwary pedestrian is liable
to tread upon it.&nbsp; It is the more dangerous because it is
apt to vary in colour, according to the locality which it
frequents, and therefore is the less easily observed.&nbsp; The
colour is always some shade of brown, from a dull yellow to an
olive tint; but it may be specially known by the zigzag, black
markings along the back, and its broad head, with V-shaped mark
in the centre.&nbsp; Its length is from a foot to a
foot-and-a-half, although specimens have been killed as long as
four feet.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Naturalist,&rdquo; 1895, p. 206.)&nbsp;
The female is larger than the male.&nbsp; Its bite is made with
great rapidity, so that there is little opportunity to escape
it.&nbsp; The poison is very virulent, and we are told that in
some cases it has proved fatal, but that was probably in the case
of a naturally inflammatory subject.&nbsp; The writer has killed
several at different times, on the Moor, near Woodhall.&nbsp; On
one occasion, on a hot day in September, when a friend was
shooting with him, the dog of the friend was bitten.&nbsp; It
immediately howled, and seemed to be in considerable pain.&nbsp;
He was in time to see the adder and to kill it.&nbsp; He then
hurried off with the dog and caught a train to Horncastle, where
a dose of <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Eau de Luce was administered, and the
dog recovered.&nbsp; Olive oil, also, well rubbed into the bitten
part, is said to be an effective remedy, and is often more easily
obtainable.&nbsp; Another variety of snake found here is what is
commonly called the &ldquo;slow worm&rdquo; or &ldquo;blind
worm&rdquo; (Anguis fragilis), which is generally seen in moist
meadow ground.&nbsp; It is from 10 to 16 inches in length, and
quite harmless.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, it is a lizard, not a
snake.&nbsp; The only other kind is the common grass snake
(coluber natrix).&nbsp; This is fairly common.&nbsp; The writer
has seen three linked together, lying on a bank in Kirkby-lane, a
favourite walk near Woodhall.&nbsp; If taken unawares, without
time to escape, it will hiss and make a show of fight, but it is
perfectly harmless and defenceless, and usually endeavours to
escape as quickly as possible, and will bury itself in the long
grass, the hedge bottom, or underground with marvellous
rapidity.&nbsp; Like the late Poet Laureate, Lord Tennyson, the
writer has more than once kept a tame snake of this species, and
has even carried it about in his coat pocket, to the astonishment
of urchins who have seen its head peeping out.&nbsp; In a state
of nature they hybernate; but when kept in a room, a favourite
resort in cold weather was among the ashes under a
fire-grate.&nbsp; If a hot coal fell from the grate into the
ashes, the snake would rush out hissing, but presently return to
its warm retreat again.&nbsp; Held out by the tail, they will try
to climb up their own body, and snap, as if to bite at
one&rsquo;s hand; but their only real mode of defence is to
inflate the body with air to its utmost power of expansion, and
then emit it again, charged with a strong odour, repulsive enough
to drive most things from it. <a name="citation71a"></a><a
href="#footnote71a" class="citation">[71a]</a>&nbsp; They are
found in length from one foot and a half to three feet; and the
writer has seen one killed, from which 32 unhatched eggs were
taken, each egg about an inch long.&nbsp; The question of snakes
swallowing their young, to shelter them from danger, though
asserted by several authorities, I have never been able to prove
or disprove, although I have often watched them. <a
name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>The Lizard (Zoctoca vivipara) is found in sandy parts of
the moor, and sunny banks, but is not very common.&nbsp; Many a
time, as a boy, I have caught it, and found, immediately
afterwards, nothing left in my hand but the tail, the rest of the
creature darting away over the ground, as if none the worse; or,
rather, as one might imagine, moving more freely when relieved of
the incumbrance.&nbsp; This &ldquo;casting&rdquo; of the tail
would seem, really, to be an interesting, self-protective
effort.&nbsp; As the partridge shams lameness in its movements,
to draw away an intruder from its young; or, conversely, as the
Russian traveller, pursued by wolves, flings away his children,
that he may escape himself; so the captured lizard, as a last
resource, casts off its tail, and leaves it, wriggling, to
attract the captor&rsquo;s attention, while its own bodily
&ldquo;better half&rdquo; seeks safety in concealment.</p>
<p>In the ponds at Woodhall the crested newt (Triton cristatus)
and the smooth newt (Triton punctatus) were found by members of
the Lincolnshire Naturalists&rsquo; Union, on their visit in
August, 1893.</p>
<p>Of the fishes of our neighbourhood I have been furnished with
the following list by the greatest local authority, who has
inherited, and personally acquired, an intimate knowledge of the
subject:&mdash;Trout (Salmo fario), river Bain; grayling
(Thymallus vulgaris), Bain; pike (Esox lucius), canal, ponds,
Witham; chub (Leuciscus cephalus), Bain; carp (Cyprinus carpio),
ponds&mdash;rarely in Witham; rudd (Cyprinus Erythrophthalmus),
Witham; bream (Abramis Brama), Witham; silver bream (Abramis
Blicca), ponds; roach (Leuciscus rutilus), ponds, canals, Bain;
dace (Leuciscus vulgaris), ponds, canal, Bain; blick (Alburnus
lucidus), Witham; minnow (Leuciscus Phoxinus), Bain; tench,
(Tinca vulgaris), ponds; perch (Perca fluviatilis), canal; loach
(Nemachilus barbatulus), canal and river Waring; gudgeon (Gobio
fluviatilis), canal, Bain, Waring, Witham; miller&rsquo;s thumb
(Gobio cottus), canal; stickleback or blue-eyed sailor
(Gasterosteus aculeatus), Waring and ponds; lampern, or lamprey,
or nine-eyed eel (Pteromyzon fluviatilis), Bain and Waring;
burbot (Gadus lota), Witham; eel (Anguilla vulgaris), Witham,
Bain, and ponds.</p>
<p>On some of these fishes I may here make a few remarks.&nbsp;
The grayling, &ldquo;Thymellus,&rdquo; or &ldquo;thyme
scented&rdquo; fish, is not indigenous, but has, of late years,
been imported from the small river Eau, at Claythorpe, near
Alford; and it is now breeding in the river Bain.&nbsp; It is
also <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>called the &ldquo;umber,&rdquo; or &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;
fish, because it does not lie near the surface, like the trout,
but deeper down, and darts up at the fly, like a grey, dim shadow
in the water.&nbsp; A recent angling author, referring to this
habit of the fish, speaks of casting his fly &ldquo;on the
surface of a deep pool on the Doon, in which the shadowy form of
the grayling could be seen three feet below.&nbsp; A fish would
shoot up with a rush, seize the fly, and drop backward to the
bottom.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Angling Holidays,&rdquo; by C. W.
Gedney, pp. 8, 9.)&nbsp; The special month for grayling fishing
is August, and onward through the winter.&nbsp; The rudd, found
in the Witham, is not unlike the roach, but a thicker fish, with
sides and back almost of a green tinge.&nbsp; It has been taken
up to 2&frac12;lb., but from 1 to 1&frac12;lb. is a commoner
weight.&nbsp; It acquires its name from its red (ruddy-coloured)
eyes.&nbsp; The blick is like the dace, but smaller and lighter
in colour; very quick in taking the fly.&nbsp; Its average size
is four to five inches.&nbsp; The stickleback, or
&ldquo;blue-eyed sailor,&rdquo; is found almost
everywhere&mdash;in pond and stream.&nbsp; It is remarkable for
building a nest, almost like that of a bird, attached to the stem
of a reed or some other aquatic plant, which the male fish
defends with great pugnacity &ldquo;against all
comers.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be said to occupy a place among our
fishes, analogous to that of the kingfisher among our birds, as
being decked with brighter colours than any other kind;
especially is this the case in time of excitement, as when
defending the nest.&nbsp; It then darts about, with all its
spines erect, and flashing with green and gold and red.&nbsp;
Anyone who thrusts a stick into the water near the nest may
witness this for himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sticklebacks were formerly
found in such large quantities in fen waters that they were made
a source of considerable profit, being boiled down for the oil
they contained, and the refuse sold as manure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Thompson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boston,&rdquo; p. 368.)&nbsp; The
miller&rsquo;s thumb is about the size of a gudgeon, to which it
is allied, but has a head broader than its body, whence it gets
its other name of &ldquo;bull-head.&rdquo;&nbsp; The burbot has
something of the flavour of the eel.&nbsp; The lamprey gets its
name of the &ldquo;nine-eyed eel&rdquo; from nine orifices along
the side of the throat, through which the water passes from the
gills.&nbsp; It is sometimes said to be poisonous, but the
Germans eat them as a delicacy.&nbsp; Carp, of the
&ldquo;Lake&rdquo; variety, were put into the Witham several
years ago, and they are occasionally taken 10lb. or 12lb. in
weight.&nbsp; The ordinary pond carp is no longer known near <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Woodhall, but they survive in a pond, where the writer
has caught them, at Wispington.&nbsp; They are a somewhat insipid
fish, although at one time highly esteemed.&nbsp; There was an
old saying that the &ldquo;carp was food fit for an abbot, the
barbel for a king.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tench were found in great numbers
in a pond which formerly existed on the site now occupied by
&ldquo;Oranienhof&rdquo; Villa, within 150 yards of the Victoria
Hotel.&nbsp; They have also been taken in the river Witham, but
are now thought to be extinct.&nbsp; Very large tench were
formerly abundant in a moat surrounding the house where the
writer now lives.&nbsp; They are difficult to take with worm or
paste, as, by continual sucking, they get the bait off the hook
without being caught.&nbsp; The largest, sometimes weighing 3lb.
or more, were taken in a wickerwork trap, of the shape of a
dice-box, some 3ft. long, with the willow withes pointing inwards
at each end.&nbsp; This was baited with a peony, or any
gay-coloured flower; attracted by which, the tench found their
way inwards, but could not get out.&nbsp; Every pond in Kirkstead
has its fish; fish doubtless of ancient lineage, the descendants
of those on which monks and abbotts once fattened.&nbsp; In an
early blackletter edition of Chaucer, there is a fragment of a
poem, called &ldquo;The Pilgrym&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; which begins
with these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In Lyncolneshyr, fast by the fene,<br />
Ther stant an hows, and you yt ken.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Todd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gower and
Chaucer,&rdquo; p. iv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which might well apply to the &ldquo;hows,&rdquo; or
monastery, of Kirkstead.&nbsp; Every such Religious House had its
&ldquo;fish stews,&rdquo; or ponds, keeping, as Chaucer says,
&ldquo;Many a bream, and many a luce (pike) in stew, and many a
fat partrich eke in mewe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Cistercian rules of
diet were very severe, allowing only one meal a day, and none but
the sickly were permitted to partake of animal food.&nbsp;
Consequently, fish were in great demand, and the greater the
variety, the more toothsome would be the monastic fare. <a

in the Witham, and attain a very fair size, not unfrequently up
to 1&frac14;lb.; and the artizans of Sheffield, and elsewhere,
brought by special trains, in hundreds, often carry away with
them very fair baskets.&nbsp; Bream of both kinds are very
abundant in the Witham.&nbsp; I am told by one angler that he has
seen the water crowded with shoals of them, and they are caught
up to 6lb. in weight, and even more.&nbsp; I have before me the
paper-cut shape of a bream caught near Tattershall, which weighed
5&frac14;lb., was 21 inches in length, and about 20 inches in
girth.&nbsp; Chub in the river Bain, between Horncastle and
Roughton, and again between Tattershall and Dogdyke, are caught
weighing several pounds.&nbsp; They are a wary fish, but, when
hooked, fight hard for a while, and then suddenly collapse.&nbsp;
The writer has often, in the early morning or late evening, sat
by the river fishing for them with black slug, and seen two or
three big fish, 1&frac12;ft. in length, slowly rising and sinking
in the stream, as they examined the bait.&nbsp; A chub was taken
in the Bain, in 1898, with the spoon-bait, weighing 4lb.
10oz.&nbsp; The Pike attains a good size in some of the ponds in
the neighbourhood, and also in the river Witham.&nbsp; In a large
pond, about three-quarters of a mile from the Bath-house, at an
abandoned brickyard known as &ldquo;Jordan&rsquo;s Pond,&rdquo; a
near relative of the writer, a few years ago, landed a pike
weighing between 13lbs. and 14lbs.&nbsp; It was currently
reported for several years that there was a much larger pike in
this pond, which those who had seen it estimated at 20lbs.
weight.&nbsp; A resident near has told the writer that he has
seen it, holding across its jaws a captured fish fully a foot
long.&nbsp; This pike disappeared, it is believed in the night,
in the year 1897.&nbsp; Doubtless the nocturnal marauder has kept
his own counsel from that day to this.&nbsp; There is an old
laconic expression, &ldquo;Witham pike, none like,&rdquo; which
is only a condensed form of an older adage,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ancholme eels, and Witham pike,<br />
In all the world there&rsquo;s none syke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pike of the Witham were evidently famed of yore, for
Drayton, in his Polyolbion (Song XXV.), personifying the Witham,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus to her proper song the burthen still she
bare,<br />
Yet for my dainty pikes I am beyond compare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walter de Gaunt (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1115) granted
to the <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span

the Witham, and a fishery on the Witham at Dogdyke (Dock-dike)
was granted to the Abbot of Kirkstead by Philip de Kyme (<span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1162), which were privileges, in those
times, of considerable value.&nbsp; (Reliqui&oelig; galen&oelig;,
Introd., p. xxiii.).&nbsp; Records in the Archives of Lincoln
state that when Henry VII. visited Lincoln, in 1486, keeping his
Easter there, and &ldquo;humbly and christenly did wesh the feet
of 30 poore menne with his noble hands,&rdquo; he was entertained
at a banquet, to which the Mayor contributed &ldquo;12 grete
pykes, 12 grete tenches, and 12 salmons&rdquo;; <a
name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a> and on a second visit, after his
victory at Stoke field, the Corporation presented him with
&ldquo;2 fatte oxen, 20 fatte muttons, 12 fatte capons, and 6
grete fatte pykes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pike have been taken in
the Fens,&rdquo; says Mr. Skertchly, in his &ldquo;Fenland&rdquo;
(p. 398), &ldquo;from 20lbs. to 24lbs.&nbsp; The largest known
was taken when Whittlesea Mere was drained.&nbsp; It weighed
100lbs., and was given to the late naturalist, Frank
Buckland.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are fine pike in the lake at Sturton
Hall, where permission to fish may generally be obtained; and the
present would seem to be an opportunity for placing on record
that when, early in this century, the lake, of some eight acres
in extent, was first formed by damming the stream which ran
through the Park, it was stocked with pike and other fish from
the moat which then enclosed the residence of the present writer,
Langton Rectory.&nbsp; I find among my notes on Witham pike
fishing, that in 1890 one angler <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a> took, in two
hours, five fish, weighing altogether 31lbs.; the largest scaling
over a stone (14lbs.), measured 35&frac12; inches in length and
19 inches in girth.&nbsp; A few days later he landed fishes of
7lbs. and 5lbs., while another angler, about the same date,
secured a pike of 16lbs.&nbsp; But a Horncastle fisherman, <a
name="citation76c"></a><a href="#footnote76c"
class="citation">[76c]</a> in the same week, captured one of
18lbs. in the Witham near Tattershall.&nbsp; One of our greatest
anglers states that his largest pike, taken in the Witham, was
16&frac14;lbs.; that he has landed 23 pike in one day, of all
sizes, and 20 the next day, making 43 fish in two days.&nbsp; In
the closing week of the season 1898&ndash;1899, a season below
the average, a pike was taken in the Witham, near Tattershall,
weighing 22lbs.</p>
<p>The late vicar of Tattershall, the Rev. <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Mortimer
Latham, to whose memory the writer would here pay his tribute of
regard and respect for as genuine, and withal as genial, an
angler as Isaac Walton himself, &ldquo;knew,&rdquo; as we might
say, &ldquo;by heart,&rdquo; the Witham, its finny occupants, and
their haunts; and many a fine fish he landed, the shapes of which
he kept, cut out in brown paper, in his study.&nbsp; The largest
pike he ever took weighed 19&frac12;lbs.&nbsp; I have before me,
as I write, the paper-cut shape of this fish, lent to me by his
daughter; who writes: &ldquo;It may interest you to know that it
was conveyed home in a bolster slip, and was on view in the
vicarage courtyard, to the great entertainment of the whole
village.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its length was 38 inches, girth about 21
inches.&nbsp; She further adds: &ldquo;My father, at one time,
caught several tench (now supposed to be extinct in the Witham),
and I am proud to say that the last one known to be captured was
taken by myself, for being one of the keenest fishermen that even
Lincolnshire ever produced, he made us as ardent fisherfolk as
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have also the shape of a perch caught by
him, weighing 2&frac12;lbs., length 15&frac12;ins., girth about
12ins.</p>
<p>No fish is so &ldquo;coy and hard to please&rdquo; as the
pike.&nbsp; Of them may be said, what someone has said of
women,</p>
<blockquote><p>If they will, they will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You may depend on&rsquo;t;<br />
And if they won&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proverbial &ldquo;variabile semper&rdquo; element is their
characteristic feature, a living illustration of a line, pregnant
with meaning, of Coleridge,</p>
<blockquote><p>Naught may endure but mutability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one occasion, a well-known angler tells me, he fished three
long hours in a gale of wind, which nearly carried him into the
river, without stirring a fin, and then, an unaccountable change
of mood coming over the &ldquo;water wolves,&rdquo; through the
next hour and a half they &ldquo;took like mad,&rdquo; and he
landed 42&frac12;lb. weight.&nbsp; At the time two Sheffield men
were fishing close by, who had been at the work for three days,
and had landed only a few bream or roach, and one small
jack.&nbsp; Under their very noses he landed three splendid pike,
while they looked on thunderstruck.&nbsp; Such are the fortunes
of war with fishermen.&nbsp; On another occasion, when the day
was dull and calm, and there was nothing, one would have thought,
to stir the fish to any animation, he landed at the same spot one
pike of 16&frac14;lb., and three of 9lb. odd each.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;pike are
unaccountable.&rdquo;&nbsp; In December, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>1898, a boy
caught a pike of 16lb. weight in the Horncastle Canal, at
Tattershall, 3&frac12; feet in length and 9 inches in girth; and
another of 11lbs. was taken in the Witham, shortly after; and
other cases of 14lb., and so on, are recorded.&nbsp; Pike, as is
well known, are exceedingly voracious, and not very particular as
to what they eat.&nbsp; A writer in the &ldquo;Naturalist&rdquo;
<a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a> states that a pair of Shoveller ducks
nested in a disused brickpit, and brought off their young; but a
pike in the pit gradually carried them off, one by one, taking
one when it was large enough to fly.&nbsp; The same fish
destroyed nearly the whole of another brood of ducks, hatched at
the same pit.&nbsp; The present writer has himself witnessed a
similar occurrence.&nbsp; He at one time kept (as he does still)
wild ducks, which nested on the banks of the moat surrounding the
house.&nbsp; There were large pike in the moat, and he has
frequently heard a duck give a quack of alarm, has seen a curl on
the water, and on counting his ducklings, found that there was
one less.&nbsp; And if pike are not particular as to their
diet&mdash;all being grist that comes to the mill&mdash;neither
are they particular as to the bait, if <i>they are in the
humour</i>.</p>
<p>The writer, in a day&rsquo;s fishing for trout, in a Scotch
river, the Teviot, where he took perhaps a score or two in the
day, would vary the sport on coming to a deep pool by taking off
his flies, putting on stout gimp tackle, with a single large
hook, which was run through the body of a small trout, or parr;
and would often, in this way, land a good pike or two.&nbsp;
Sometimes when drawing in the pike too hastily, it would disgorge
the bait and hook, but on his making another cast, and letting
them float down the pool again, the pike would return to the
charge, unwarned by experience, and be eventually captured.&nbsp;
On one occasion, rowing leisurely in a boat on Loch Vennachar,
with his rod over the stern, and line trailing behind him, a
trout, of a pound weight or so, took the fly, and hooked
itself.&nbsp; This was immediately seized by a good-sized pike,
and after a hard fight he secured both with gut tackle.&nbsp;
Dining with the Marchioness who owned the above river, he was
regaled on a 10lb. or 12lb. pike, which the Lady Cecil had caught
that day, her boat being pushed along the river by a gillie,
himself walking in the water, and she fishing with a single large
hook, baited with a piece of red cloth.</p>
<p>We have quoted the lines celebrating the pike of the Witham,
and the eels of the Ancholme <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>(also a
Lincolnshire river), but eels were, at one time, abundant also in
the Witham.&nbsp; Large tubs containing hundreds of them used to
be taken to Horncastle on market days, or were hawked about to
the country houses.&nbsp; It is said that as many as 16,000 eels
have been taken in one year.&nbsp; If you bought eels from these
hawkers, they were brought to your kitchen door alive, and, being
difficult creatures to handle, your cook generally got the seller
to skin them alive, and they were often put into the pan for
stewing before they had ceased wriggling.&nbsp; Hence the phrase
to &ldquo;get accustomed to a thing; as eels do to
skinning.&rdquo;&nbsp; But an eel can only be once skinned in its
life, and even the skin, stript from its writhing body, was
supposed to possess a &ldquo;virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; If tied round a
leg or an arm, it was considered a remedy, or preventive, for
rheumatism; and your cook would sometimes preserve the skin for a
rheumatic friend.&nbsp; In these days the eels brought to market
are few, and not half the size they used to be.&nbsp; Eels, from
2ft. to 3ft. long, and as thick as one&rsquo;s wrist, were
formerly quite common.&nbsp; Eels are supposed to migrate to the
sea, and, in the year 1903, a large eel was found, early in the
morning, about 100 yards from a large pond, in the parish of
Wispington, travelling across a grass field, towards a stream, by
which it might eventually reach the sea.</p>
<p>The only other fish which I have to remark upon is the
trout.&nbsp; They are not found in the Witham; but the Bain trout
are handsome; both the golden, or rich yellow kind, with pink
spots, and the purple or mauve-coloured variety, but the former
are much finer in flavour.&nbsp; For some years the swans on the
Horncastle Canal made great havoc among the young trout and spawn
<a name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a> in the neighbouring river Bain, but
the last swan died in 1897.&nbsp; Further, there is now an
artificial breeding tank established at Horncastle, managed by
Mr. Rushton, for keeping up the supply.&nbsp; Some very fine fish
have been taken at different times.&nbsp; My notes record as
follows:&mdash;In April, 1896, one of the anglers already
referred to <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a> caught a trout in the Bain, close to
Horncastle, weighing 4lb. 6oz., 23in. in length.&nbsp; The same
fisherman, in July, 1888, took another, within half a mile of the
same place, weighing 4lb. 10oz., 23in. in length.&nbsp; The son
<a name="citation79c"></a><a href="#footnote79c"
class="citation">[79c]</a> of a quondam veteran angler, <!-- page
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and
himself one of our keenest fishermen, tells me that he, several
years ago, assisted his father to land a male trout of 7lb.
weight, from the watermill pool at Horncastle.&nbsp; It fought so
hard that he and his brother had to rush into the water and take
it in their arms, their father&rsquo;s tackle not being intended
for such a monster. <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a>&nbsp; This,
however, was surpassed by a trout taken by the late Mr. Robert
Clitherow, of Horncastle, <i>a beau ideal</i> disciple of the
gentle craft, which weighed 8lbs.</p>
<p>Probably the handsomest trout in the neighbourhood, though not
the largest, are those of the Somersby &ldquo;beck,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Brook,&rdquo; rendered for ever classical by the sweet
poem of the late Poet Laureate.&nbsp; In years gone by the writer
has enjoyed many a picnic on its banks, when we used to pull off
our shoes and stockings, and turn up our trousers&mdash;gentlemen
as well as boys&mdash;to catch the trout by the process called
&ldquo;tickling&rdquo; them, while hiding in their holes; which
the ladies afterwards cooked on a fire extemporised on the
bank.&nbsp; The music of the rippling stream haunts one still, as
one reads those liquid lines of the poet, themselves almost a
runnel:</p>
<blockquote><p>I chatter over stony ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In little sharps and trebles;<br />
I bubble into eddying bays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I babble on the pebbles. <a
name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-five or thirty years ago, the dykes in the Fens, near
the Witham, abounded in fish of the coarser kinds, with some
goodly pike among them.&nbsp; As a boy the writer has caught many
a pike by the process called &ldquo;sniggling,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, a noose of wire, or gimp, attached to the end of a
stiff rod, or stick, which is deftly slipt over a fish&rsquo;s
head, as he basks among the water weeds, and, when thus snared,
he is jerked ashore.&nbsp; When shooting in the Fens he has also
killed, at one shot, five or six fish crowded together in a
dyke.&nbsp; But climatic alterations, and over-perfect drainage,
have changed all this.&nbsp; The water now runs out to sea so
rapidly that the <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Fen drains are dry for a great part
of the year, and the fish are no more.</p>
<p>Enough has now been said to show that the visitor to Woodhall
Spa, who has a taste for &ldquo;the contemplative man&rsquo;s
recreation,&rdquo; <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a> may find some employment in its
vicinity.&nbsp; Most of the ponds can be fished on asking the
farmers&rsquo; permission.&nbsp; As to the Witham, although there
are angling clubs at Boston and Lincoln, the river is practically
open to every one, in the season.&nbsp; It may be added that
close to Tattershall station there is a large &ldquo;ballast
pond&rdquo; containing good pike, and a letter to the shooting
tenant, or to Lord Fortescue&rsquo;s agent, would probably obtain
permission to fish.&nbsp; At Revesby there is a reservoir, the
source of the water supply of Boston, a large piece of water,
which abounds in fish of various kinds.&nbsp; Bream, both of the
silver and the carp kinds, are plentiful, running up to 4lb. in
weight.&nbsp; Very large eels are taken there.&nbsp; Roach are of
a fair size.&nbsp; Rudd are numerous; as also are perch, but
small.&nbsp; Gudgeons are plentiful, serving for bait.&nbsp; Pike
are abundant.&nbsp; In one case three were taken by the same rod
within twenty minutes, one of them weighing 13lb.&nbsp; Another
rod took two of 16lb. and 10lb., and it is commonly said that
there is one occasionally seen &ldquo;as long as a
rail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Permission may be obtained to fish here from
the agent of the Hon. Mrs. Stanhope, Revesby Abbey.&nbsp; There
is good accommodation at the Red Lion Hotel.</p>
<p>As, in the next chapter, I am to enter upon a different branch
of my subject, passing roughly speaking, from the organic to
inorganic&mdash;from the living to the dead&mdash;I will here
give a few particulars, recently received, which may interest the
entomologist.&nbsp; In the month of August, 1898, I conducted the
members of our county Naturalists&rsquo; Union from Woodhall Spa

84</span>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; GEOLOGICAL NOTES.</h2>
<p>In a county like Lincolnshire, mainly agricultural, in which
the operations of man are, for the most part, confined to the
earth&rsquo;s crust, in ploughing and sowing, and, as some one
has said, in &ldquo;tickling&rdquo; the earth&rsquo;s surface
into fertility,&mdash;in such a county we are not led ordinarily
to explore the inner bowels of the world; as is necessary in
mining districts such as certain parts of Yorkshire, Durham,
Cornwall and elsewhere.&nbsp; Yet, with regard to our knowledge
of its geological features, Woodhall may be said to compare
favourably with a large majority of places.&nbsp; With one
exception <a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a> it is the spot, <i>par excellence</i>,
in this part of the kingdom, where the earth&rsquo;s hidden
resources have been tapped, and tapped to considerable purpose,
in the unique commodity for which it is famed&mdash;its mineral
water.&nbsp; The book of Nature, so often &ldquo;sealed,&rdquo;
has here been opened and its contents indexed.&nbsp; We have in
the strata of the Woodhall well sundry chapters in the
earth&rsquo;s past history unfolded, at least to the
initiated.&nbsp; The writer is not going to attempt here a
systematic disquisition on a subject so abstruse (for which,
indeed, he is not qualified), beyond touching upon some of its
more salient, or more interesting features.&nbsp; The geological
records of the Woodhall well have already been given <a
name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a> in the very concise form in which they
have been preserved for us.&nbsp; Whether they are to be entirely
depended upon is questionable, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>but we may
here repeat them:&mdash;Gravel and boulder clay, 10 feet;
Kimeridge and Oxford clays, 350; Kellaways rock, blue clays,
cornbrash, limestone, great oolite, clay and limestone, upper
Estuarine clay, 140; Lincolnshire oolite, and Northampton sand,
140; lias, upper, middle, and lower, 380 feet; total, 1,120
feet.&nbsp; The mineral spring is said to have issued from a
stratum of spongy rock lying at a depth of 540ft. <a
name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a>&nbsp; This would probably be in or
near the ferruginous Northampton sand, the lowest layer of the
oolite, and lying immediately above the upper lias. <a
name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a></p>
<p>In the year 1897 a boring was commenced within 500 yards of
the original well by the artesian engineers, Messrs. Isler and
Co., on behalf of the Rev. J. O. Stephens, on the west side of
the Stixwould road, with a view to obtaining a second supply of
the Woodhall water; this was carried to a depth of 700
feet.&nbsp; The engineers furnished me with a register of the
strata so far pierced by the bore, but, as they are not described
in the technical terms of geology, it is rather difficult to
compare them with those of the old well.&nbsp; At a depth of 490
feet, sandstone with iron pyrites was pierced; this would
probably be the ferruginous Northampton sand of the Oolite.&nbsp;
It is at a less depth than the same stratum at the Spa well; but
that was to be expected, as geologists state that all the
geological strata &ldquo;dip&rdquo; eastward, and this bore being
to the west, the stratum would naturally tilt upward.&nbsp; This
born was ultimately abandoned.&nbsp; According to the records of
the Spa well, derived from Dr. Snaith, of Horncastle, who knew
the well from its birth, the saline spring was found at 540ft.;
but Dr. Granville, who visited Woodhall, and wrote his <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>version, in 1841, puts it at 510ft.&nbsp; It is
difficult to say which of these two doctors, who differ, should
be accepted as the more trustworthy; and in 1841 Dr. Granville
would still certainly be able to find plenty of persons familiar
with the well and its details.&nbsp; But in the ferruginous sand,
or near it, the spring was to be expected; and there it would
seem Messrs. Isler, in the new boring, found saline water, though
only in small quantity.&nbsp; The depth, according to their
computation, was, as we have said 490ft., which is 20ft. above
the Spa spring&rsquo;s level, according to Granville&rsquo;s
version, and 60ft. above the depth given by Snaith.&nbsp; The
paucity of the supply of the saline water in the Isler boring may
probably be accounted for thus: The trend of the current found in
making the Spa well was said to be from south-east to north-west,
whereas this new bore is very nearly due west from the Spa
well.&nbsp; If, therefore, the stream is of narrow width, this
later boring is scarcely in the position to catch more than the
side soakage of the current, and it would seem that the main
stream can only be tapped either by another boring further north,
or by a lateral shaft from the present bore running northward
till it encounters the current.&nbsp; There remains, of course,
the further and open question as to whether the saline stream
formerly passing <i>through</i> the Spa shaft, still continues
its former north-westerly course, after having the outlet
afforded by that shaft.&nbsp; Would it not be more in accordance
with the law of nature that the stream should take the course of
least resistance by rising in the well, and not flowing further
along the bed of its special original stratum?&nbsp; If that be
so, the only chance of another well would be to bore
south-eastward of the Spa; and probably the shaft sunk by the
late Mr. Blyton beside Coalpit Wood, if it had been continued,
would have proved a safer venture than any other as yet
attempted.&nbsp; At some future time we may have the wolf
disturbing the stream, above the lamb represented by the original
well, to the detriment of the latter.&nbsp; It may be here
noticed that in the Scarle boring, as we are told, there was
found a strong spring in the upper part of the lower Keuper
sandstone at the depth of 790ft., and a still stronger spring at
the base of that formation at 950ft.&nbsp; In that case,
therefore, as also at Woodhall, the water was found in sandstone,
but at a much greater depth, and also in sandstone of a different
character, viz., the Keuper at Scarle, the Northampton at
Woodhall.&nbsp; Another difference is that in the <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Scarle strata we pass at once from the surface drift to
the lower Lias; the Kimeridge clay and all the Oolite formations,
which are found at Woodhall, with a thickness of some 630ft.,
being entirely absent.&nbsp; These differences, of course,
illustrate the fact that, owing to abrasion and other causes, not
only do the strata underlying the surface drift vary in different
localities, but their several thicknesses vary; while, as at
Harrogate, the mineral properties of the water also vary at a
distance of only a few yards.&nbsp; Pass beyond the limits of the
particular stream, and, below ground as well as above it, you are
not &ldquo;in the swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1904, Mr. R. A. Came, of the Royal Hotel,
commenced sinking a shaft, in search of the Spa water, at a point
some &frac34; mile south of the original well; and early in 1905
water was struck at a depth of 492 feet, which proved to have the
same saline properties, with the addition of Epsom salt, a good
supply issuing from the spongy sandstone.&nbsp; This opens up a
vista of great possibilities in the future; it does away with the
monopoly hitherto existing, and may have a most important effect,
in the further development of the Spa.&nbsp; The well is 7ft. in
diameter, is bricked to a depth of 495ft., and sunk to
520ft.&nbsp; The boring was carried out by Mr. Joseph Aldridge,
of Measham, near Atherstone, Warwickshire, an expert mining
engineer.&nbsp; Many fine fossils, as ammonites, belemnites, and
bi-valves, were found in the different strata that were
pierced.</p>
<p>I now proceed to remark upon some of the geological strata, as
found at Woodhall.&nbsp; And first, after the mere surface
gravel, we have the Boulder clay.&nbsp; This has a very
interesting history.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Life of Nansen,&rdquo;
the Arctic traveller, it is stated <a name="citation87a"></a><a
href="#footnote87a" class="citation">[87a]</a> that the
geological strata of the Arctic regions show that at some remote
period the climatic conditions were the reverse of those which
prevail now.&nbsp; Throughout those regions, at present of
intense cold, there was quite a southern climate, in which walnut
trees, magnolias, vines, etc., flourished; while, on the other
hand, there was also a period during which our own country, and
large parts of the Continent, lying in the same latitude, were
buried under vast ice-fields with an Esquimaux climate.&nbsp; It
is there further stated <a name="citation87b"></a><a
href="#footnote87b" class="citation">[87b]</a> that boulders are
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>found scattered over Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which
have been transported thither on glaciers, from regions still
further north.&nbsp; In like manner glaciers at one time also
spread over what are now Scotland and a great part of England,
bringing along with them boulders from Norway, and Scandinavia
generally.&nbsp; The present condition of Greenland, with its
vast glaciers, pouring through its valleys, down to the
water&rsquo;s edge, on the sea shore, illustrates the condition
of our own country at that remote period. <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a>&nbsp; As regards this country, these
ice-streams may be classed under two distinct heads, (<i>a</i>)
the native, inland glaciers, and (<i>b</i>) the north-eastern,
Scandinavian glacier.&nbsp; To speak first of the former.&nbsp;
As the climate, from causes into which we cannot here enter, <a
name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a> gradually became coldier, glaciers
were formed among the rugged hills in the present lake country of
Cumberland and Westmoreland, some of which pushed their way
westward, literally inch by inch, until they debouched in the
Irish Sea, and filled it to overflowing, for it is only
shallow.&nbsp; From Borrowdale, Buttermere, Eskdale, and other
head centres, they also streamed southward and eastward.&nbsp;
There was an immense central stream, which forced its way over
the wild tract of Stainmoor (named doubtless from the thousands
of boulders with which it is strewn); then, fed by lateral
branches from many directions, it traversed Teesdale, turned
towards the coast, passing by Scarborough, and so on to
Holderness and the Humber, a branch also filling up Airedale and
the Vale of York. <a name="citation88c"></a><a
href="#footnote88c" class="citation">[88c]</a>&nbsp; From
Holderness it passed the Humber, into Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Its
most eastern limb would doubtless have debouched in the North
Sea, and filled it; but here the north-eastern glacier, to which
I have alluded, came into collision.&nbsp; Taking its rise in
Scandinavia, it had spread into a vast sheet <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>in parts
3,000ft. thick, <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> filled up the shallow North Sea, and
the Baltic, a veritable <i>mer de glace</i>, and over-run
northern Germany, its thickness even at Berlin being supposed to
have been 1,300ft.&nbsp; Impinging on our eastern coast of
Scotland and of northern England, it spread over a great part of
Holderness, meeting and blending with the inland native glacier
on the Humber; and the vast united ice-stream thence pursued its
onward southern course, enfolding everything in its icy embrace,
to the Thames and to the Severn. <a name="citation89b"></a><a
href="#footnote89b" class="citation">[89b]</a>&nbsp; These great
ice-streams created the geological formation called &ldquo;The
Drift,&rdquo; or boulder-clay, which we have at Woodhall.&nbsp;
The clay is simply the <i>detritus</i>, produced by the grinding,
through long ages, of the rocks under the vast and weighty
ice-fields slowly moving over them, and the abrasion of the
hill-sides which they scraped in their course.&nbsp; The boulders
are detached fragments, which fell from various rocky heights
overhanging the ice-stream, rested on the surface of the
ice-sheet, were borne along by it through hundreds of miles, and
when, in the course of ages untold, the climate became milder,
and the glaciers gradually shrunk and eventually disappeared,
these fragments, often bearing the marks of ice-scraping, and
oftener rounded by ice-action, fell to the soil beneath, and
remain to this day, to bear their silent witness to the course
once taken by the giant ice-stream.&nbsp; The period through
which this process was going on has been variously computed, from
18,000 years, according to the estimate of Major-General A. W.
Drayson, F.R.A.S., who gives elaborate astronomical statistics in
support of his views (Trans. Victoria Institute, No. 104, p.
260), to 160,000, as calculated by Mr. James Croll
(&ldquo;Climate and Time&rdquo;).&nbsp; It is now generally held
that there were more than one ice-age, with inter-glacial
breaks.&nbsp; These boulders are abundant in our neighbourhood,
and of all sizes.&nbsp; <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>They may be measured by inches or by
yards.&nbsp; There is a good-sized one in the vicarage garden at
Woodhall Spa, which the present writer had carted from
Kirkby-lane, a distance of a mile and a half.&nbsp; There is a
larger one lying on the moor, near the south-east corner of the
Ostler Ground.&nbsp; The writer has one in his own garden, a
large one, more than 6ft. in length by 3&frac12;ft. high, and
2&frac12;ft. thick.&nbsp; It took five horses to drag it from its
position, a quarter of a mile distant.&nbsp; There are six
visible in the parish of Langton, two or three large ones near
Old Woodhall Church; several large ones in Thimbleby, Edlington,
and elsewhere.&nbsp; Smaller ones are often to be seen placed at
turns in the roads to prevent drivers running their vehicles into
the bank, or used as foundations to old cottages or farm
buildings; and still smaller specimens may be constantly picked
up by the pedestrian, or the sportsman, in his rambles through
the fields.&nbsp; Much interest has of late years been taken in
these boulders, arising from the distinct classes of glaciers to
which I have referred, and the consequent difference between the
nature of the boulders, as well as the source from which they
have come, according as they belong to the one class or the
other; and our Lincolnshire Naturalists&rsquo; Union have now a
special &ldquo;boulder committee&rdquo; engaged in the
investigation of this subject.</p>
<p>The late Professor Sedgewick, of Cambridge (whose lectures the
writer attended), was the first to notice that along the
Holderness shore there were (as he says) &ldquo;an incredible
number of blocks of granite, gneiss, greenstone, mica, etc.,
etc., resembling specimens derived from various parts of
Scandinavia.&rdquo; <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; These, we now
know, were dropped by the great Scandinavian glacier; and, along
with the kinds of stone here named, there are also boulders of
Rhombporphyry (the &ldquo;Rhomben porphyry&rdquo; of Norwegian
geologists, from the neighbourhood of Christiana), Augite
syenite, and several more, not of British origin.&nbsp; These
boulders are now being searched for, and found in our own
neighbourhood.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is the different
class of boulders which were brought down by the native inland
glaciers.&nbsp; These consist largely of igneous kinds.&nbsp; The
rugged hills of the Lake district owe their origin to fire; and
the boulders which the glaciers have transported
correspond.&nbsp; The shap granite, for instance, which is
probably one of the commonest of this <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>class, comes
from the shap granite bed of Wastdale, in Cumberland.&nbsp;
Boulders of this rock, as Mr. Kendall tells us, &ldquo;passed
over Stainmoor in tens of thousands,&rdquo; <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a> to visit us in Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Other kinds are Felspar porphyry from
Eskdale, in Cumberland, Andesite from Borrowdale, Granophyr from
Ennerdale and Buttermere, Quartz, Basalt, and several more from
the crystalline formations in the Lake district.&nbsp; Several
boulders of these rocks have also been found in our own
neighbourhood; and doubtless more remain to reward the explorer.
<a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a>&nbsp; I have dwelt at some length on
this particular formation&mdash;the boulder clay&mdash;because it
is the most ready to hand; it lies on the surface, in many parts
around us, within the ken of the ordinary visitor to Woodhall
Spa.&nbsp; It may give an additional interest to his rambles in
search of health, to know that he may, at any moment, pick up a
boulder which has travelled further, and passed through more
strange vicissitudes, than he can well have done himself;
perhaps, with Shakespeare, to read &ldquo;Sermons in
Stones,&rdquo; and to moralise on the brevity of human life, with
all its ailments, compared with those ages untold, through which
the pebble in his hand slowly <a name="citation91c"></a><a
href="#footnote91c" class="citation">[91c]</a> travelled on its
long, laborious journey, to rest at length as a constituent
element of the locality, where he himself is seeking relief and
recreation.</p>
<p>To the west of Woodhall Spa, beyond the Stixwould-road, near
the vicarage, and northward, the surface sand, in some parts, at
the depth of a foot, or slightly more, hardens into an ironstone,
so compact that tree roots cannot penetrate it.&nbsp; In
root-pruning or manuring apple-trees, I have found the tap-root
stunted <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>into a large round knob, further
downward growth being prevented by this indurated
formation.&nbsp; This oxide of iron also pervades the sandy soil,
in parts, to a depth of four or five feet, impregnating the water
with ferruginous properties, so that it &ldquo;ferrs&rdquo;
bottles, or vessels, in which it is allowed to stand for any
length of time.&nbsp; In consequence, the water frequently has a
dull appearance, although the iron may probably make it a
wholesome tonic.</p>
<p>The surface sand, which is of a still lighter character on the
moor ground in Woodhall, and in Martin, Roughton, and Kirkby,
contiguous to Woodhall, is what is technically called the
&ldquo;Old Blown Sand,&rdquo; borne by the winds from the whilom
salt marshflats of the Witham, when it was much wider than at
present, and a tidal arm of the sea.&nbsp; It is comparatively a
recent formation, yet abounding in fine particles, or pebbles, of
quartz, and other elements of far earlier date; the larger of
these are often rounded by tidal action.&nbsp; Below this surface
sand we find, in many parts, a blue clay of varying depth.&nbsp;
In a pit called Jordan&rsquo;s pond, in an abandoned brickyard on
the east of the road to Stixwould, it is at least 16ft. thick;
also, in a large pit in Kirkstead, near Hogwood, some half-mile
south-east of the Abbey Inn, which was dug to procure this clay,
for &ldquo;claying&rdquo; the light super-soil, otherwise almost
barren, it is many feet thick.&nbsp; Ammonites and other fossils
are plentiful in it, often cemented together with veins of
gypsum.&nbsp; Both these pits are mentioned in the Government
Geological Survey (pp. 152, 153) of &ldquo;The country around
Lincoln.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close by the latter pit the writer once
found a curious fossil, which was for some time a puzzle to all
who saw it.&nbsp; It is now in the British Museum, and was
pronounced to be an Echinus crashed into an Ammonite.</p>
<p>The Kimeridge clay, named as the next stratum in the bore of
the Woodhall well, crops up first about Halstead Hall in
Stixwould, and continues through Woodhall to Horncastle, and so
on to Wragby and Market Rasen.&nbsp; It abounds in fossils.&nbsp;
Mr. Skertchly <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> found in the first of the pits just
named, that this clay was divided into three layers, the upper
being a line of Septaria (or nodules) full of serpul&aelig; one
foot in depth, then soft dark-blue clay, 6ft.; and below that
another course of Septaria; and <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Professor J.
R. Blake records from this pit the following fossils<a
name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a>:&mdash;Belemnites nitidus, Ammonites
serratus, Rissoa mosensis, Avicula &aelig;diligensis, Cyprina
cyreneformis, Ostrea deltoides, Lima &aelig;dilignensis, Thracia
depressa, Arca, Serpula tetragona.&nbsp; In other pits in the
neighbourhood several other fossils have been found. <a
name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a>&nbsp; [For a list of fossils found
about Woodhall see Appendix II.]&nbsp; A peculiarity of this
stratum is that the upper part of it contains bands of
&ldquo;inflammable shales,&rdquo; being blue, laminated,
bituminous clays, which burn readily.&nbsp; It was the presence
of these which has tempted explorers to throw away their money in
search of coal; as in the case at Donington on-Bain, where Mr.
Bogg drove a bore to the depth of 309ft., but only found clay and
thin bands of inflammable schist. <a name="citation93c"></a><a
href="#footnote93c" class="citation">[93c]</a>&nbsp; In the case
of Woodhall Spa, the money thrown away on one purpose has brought
health and wealth to others, from a source then undreamt of in
man&rsquo;s philosophy.&nbsp; We cannot leave the Kimeridge clay
without noting that its presence at Woodhall, in the position
where it is, as the <i>first</i> geological formation below the
surface drift, opens to us a vista&mdash;reveals to us a yawning
<i>hiatus</i>&mdash;which embraces a vast expanse of time.</p>
<p>In the normal order of geological strata, the whole series of
cretaceous formations have to be passed through before reaching
the Oolite formation, of which the Kimeridge clay forms almost
the upper layer.&nbsp; But at Woodhall and the surrounding
district the whole of this series of rocks and soils is
wanting.&nbsp; Their absence is eloquent, and tells a tale of
widespread destruction.&nbsp; Standing near the Tower on the Moor
we can see in the distance, stretching from north-west to south
east, the range of hills called the &ldquo;Wolds,&rdquo; which,
with a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; of marls, or sandy and flinty loams, are
composed almost entirely of chalk; from them, near Cawkwell Hill
(the hill <i>par excellence</i> of chalk), comes the water supply
of Horncastle and Woodhall.&nbsp; They extend for a length of
some 45 miles, with a width of some six miles to eight.&nbsp; The
actual depth of the chalk is not exactly known, but a boring made
through it, near Hull, reached the <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Oolite
beneath at 530ft.&nbsp; We may perhaps, therefore, put the
average at 500ft. <a name="citation94a"></a><a
href="#footnote94a" class="citation">[94a]</a>&nbsp; Doubtless,
at one period, this cretaceous formation extended over the whole
tract of country, but southward and westward from the foot of the
present wolds it has since been swept away.&nbsp; And this must
have taken place before the glacial period, because the glacial
boulder clay lies upon the Kimeridge clay, which normally
underlies the chalk.&nbsp; Mr. Jukes Brown (&ldquo;Geological
Journal,&rdquo; No. 162, p. 117) says: &ldquo;The Boulder clay is
bedded against the slope of the chalk, shewing that this
escarpment had retired to its present position in pre-glacial
times.&rdquo;&nbsp; By what precise process this was effected
must be left to our savants to decide; but the remarkable fact
remains, that a solid stratum, or rather series of allied strata,
from 500ft. to 1,000ft. in thickness, has, by one process or
another, been wiped out of existence, over the large area now
coated by the Kimeridge clay.&nbsp; Through ages of enormous
length the chalk was forming as the bed of a sea; a deposit
consisting of inconceivable myriads of beautiful minute shells,
mainly of the foraminifera, which can be detected by the
microscope; and its destruction probably occupied as long a
period as its formation.</p>
<p>Mr. Jukes Brown, whom I have just quoted, says: &ldquo;The
Wold hills must have been, in some way, exposed to a severe and
long-continued detrition, when erosive agencies were very
active.&rdquo;&nbsp; Active, indeed, they must have been, to
efface from an area so extensive a solid formation from 500ft. to
1,000ft. in thickness.&nbsp; And this boulder clay, as Mr. Jukes
Brown further observes, has forced its way up the sides of the
chalk, in places, to a height varying from 300ft. to 400ft.</p>
<p>The Oxford clay, which lies next below the Kimeridge, is a
deep sea deposit, dark blue, with brown nodular stones; some of
the fossils found in it are Nucula Ornata, Ammonites Plicatilis,
A. Rotundus, Cucull&aelig;a, Gryph&aelig;a Dilatata, Leda
Phillipsii, Annelida Tetragona, and A. Tricarinata, Avicula
inequivalvis. <a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a></p>
<p>Kellaway&rsquo;s rock, which lies just below, so called from a
village in Wiltshire, near Chippenham, is a mixture of yellowish
and buff sands, with brown and buff sandstone.&nbsp; The <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>chief fossils are Gryph&aelig;a Dilatata, and G.
bilobata, Belemnites in abundance, and Avicula Braam-buriensis.
<a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a></p>
<p>The Cornbrash, which succeeds (so called also from a district
in Wiltshire, favourable to corn), is a light grey, fine-grained
limestone, often so hard as to need blasting.&nbsp; It abounds in
fossils.&nbsp; Among them are Avicula Echinata, Ostr&aelig;a
Sowerbyi, Clypeus Ptotii, Ammonites Macrocephalus, A. Herveyi,
Nucula Variabilis, Astarte Minima, Trigonia (of four kinds),
Modiola (of four kinds), Myacites (five kinds), Cypricardia,
Corbicella Bathonica, Pholadomya (two kinds), Cardium (three
kinds), Pecten (six kinds), and several more. <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a></p>
<p>The great Oolite (so named from the Greek Oon, an egg,
referring to the number of small stones, like fish-ova, found in
it) is divided into Oolite clays and O. limestone.&nbsp; The
clays are mottled green and bluish, with bands of ironstone, and
concretions of lime.&nbsp; They indicate a shallow sea, as
contrasted with the Oxford clay.&nbsp; Fossils are not numerous,
but Rhinconella Concinna, Gervillia Crassicosta, Modiola
Ungulata, Ostr&aelig;a Gregaria, O. Sowerbvi, O. Subrugulosa,
Perna Quardrata, Trigonia Flecta, and Palate of Fish are found.
<a name="citation95c"></a><a href="#footnote95c"
class="citation">[95c]</a>&nbsp; These beds correspond to the
so-called Forest Marble of the South of England.</p>
<p>The Oolite limestone beds consist of white soft limestones,
having at intervals bands of marly clay.&nbsp; This formation
burns well, and makes good lime.&nbsp; Its chief fossils are
Serpula, Rhynconella, Terebratula, and T. Intermedia, Avicula
Echinata, Corbicella, Lima Rigida, Lucina, Modiola Imbricata,
Myacites Calceiformis, Mytilus Furcatus, Ostr&aelig;a Sowerbyi,
Pecten Vagans, Pteroperna plana, Trigonia, T. costata, T. flecta,
T. striata, T. undulata. <a name="citation95d"></a><a
href="#footnote95d" class="citation">[95d]</a></p>
<p>The Estuarine deposit, underlying the great Oolite limestone,
is composed of light blue, green, and purple clays, intersected
by soft bands of sandstone, and having at its base a band of
nodular ironstone.&nbsp; It is not very fossiliferous, but the
following are found:&mdash;Rhynconella Concinna, Modiola
Imbricata, Ostr&aelig;a Sowerbyi, Monodonta. <a
name="citation95e"></a><a href="#footnote95e"
class="citation">[95e]</a>&nbsp; The sandstone bands contain
plant-markings in considerable numbers.&nbsp; As its name
implies, this formation <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>was produced as the bed of an estuary
or tidal river.</p>
<p>The next lower formation is the Lincolnshire limestone.&nbsp;
This enters largely into the making of what is called &ldquo;the
Cliff,&rdquo; which is the high land running south from Lincoln
(visible from Woodhall) to the west of the Witham Valley and the
Fens.&nbsp; It is a hard building stone, though once the muddy
bed of a sea.&nbsp; It is sub-divided into the Hibaldstow and
Kirton beds, so called because these strata are exposed in those
parishes.&nbsp; Dipping to the east, it underlies the Fens and
other upper strata to be found in the Woodhall well.&nbsp; It
abounds in fossils, there being as many as 340 species
classified, <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a> and consists, indeed, very largely of
the hard parts of shells and corals compressed into a solid
mass.&nbsp; To a Lincolnshire person, it is sufficient to say of
this stone that our grand Cathedral is mainly built of it.&nbsp;
We can only give here a few of the more frequent species of
fossils:&mdash;Three kinds of Echinus, Coral (Thecosmilia

most useful stone for building purposes.&nbsp; The so-called
&ldquo;Lincoln stone&rdquo; is largely used in our churches;
whilst the &ldquo;Ancaster quarries,&rdquo; which also belong to
this formation, are famous.&nbsp; The commissioners appointed in
1839 to report on the building stones of England, for the new
houses of Parliament, stated that &ldquo;many buildings
constructed of material similar to the Oolite of Ancaster, such
as Newark and Grantham churches, have scarcely yielded to the
effects of atmospheric influences.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Old
Lincolnshire,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 23.)&nbsp; The well-known
Colly-Weston slates are the lowest stratum of this rock.&nbsp;
The fine old Roman &ldquo;Newport Arch,&rdquo; which for some 700
years has &ldquo;braved the battle and the breeze,&rdquo; a
pretty good test of its durability, is built of this stone.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>The base on which this lowest Oolite lies is the
Northampton Sands, an irony stratum of red ferruginous sand and
sandstone, the upper portion of it also being called the Lower
Estuarine deposit.&nbsp; It is from this stratum so many springs
arise in various parts of the county, as already mentioned, and
among them the Woodhall well water.&nbsp; Its fresh water
conditions show it to have been the bed of a great river, but a
tidal river, as among the fossils which it contains some are
marine shells.&nbsp; In this formation is found the iron-stone,
which is worked at Lincoln.&nbsp; Its commoner fossils are Lima
duplicata, L. Dustonensis, Hinnites abjectus, Astarte elegans,
Cardium Buckmani, Modiola Gibbosa, Ammonites Murchisoni&aelig;,
Belemnites Acutus.&nbsp; Its ferruginous layers are (as given by
Capt. Macdakin), <a name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"
class="citation">[97a]</a>&nbsp; Peroxide bed, clay ironstone,
hard carbonate of iron, hard blue carbonate peroxidised band,
blue ferruginous sand, ironstone nodules, bed of coprolites with
iron pyrites.</p>
<p>And this brings us to the Lias formation, in which lies the
lower part, amounting to rather more than a third, of the
Woodhall wells.&nbsp; It is divided into the upper Lias of clay
and shale; the middle Lias of Marlstone rock bed, clay, and
ironstone; and the lower Lias of clays, ironstone clays,
limestones. <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b"
class="citation">[97b]</a>&nbsp; This formation, with a thickness
of from 900 to 1,000 feet, runs across England from Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire down to the coast of Dorset.&nbsp; The upper Lias of
the Woodhall wells also helps to form the slope from 100 feet to
150 feet in thickness of the escarpment called &ldquo;the
Cliff,&rdquo; to the west of the Witham Fens, and to the north of
Lincoln, by Fillingham, and so on.&nbsp; Lincoln itself stands on
Lias beds, with a capping of the lower Oolite limestone. <a
name="citation97c"></a><a href="#footnote97c"
class="citation">[97c]</a>&nbsp; It contains many Belemnites,
Lucina, Ammonites Bifrons, A. Serpentinus, A. Communis, A.
Heterophillus, Nucula Hammeri, Pleuromy&aelig;, <a
name="citation97d"></a><a href="#footnote97d"
class="citation">[97d]</a> and especially the Leda Ovum, <!--
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>which distinguishes it from other strata.&nbsp; The
middle Lias, which underlies the upper, contains Ammonites
Spinatus, A. Margaritatus (in great abundance), Rhinconella,
Icthyosauri, Plesiosauri, and fossil wood, etc. <a
name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a"
class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; The lower Lias contains
Ammonites Capricornus, with many pyrites, A. Ibex, A. Jamesoni,
A. Armatus, A. Oxynotus, A. Obtusus, A. Semicostatus, A.
Bucklandi, A. Angulatus, A. Planorbis, Gryph&oelig;a incurva very
abundant, and fossils of many other kinds. <a
name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a>&nbsp; This brings us to the base of
the Woodhall Spa wells.&nbsp; For a full list of the fossils so
far found at Woodhall, the reader is referred to Appendix II. at
the and of this volume.</p>
<p>These strata are shewn in the diagram given at the head of
this chapter.</p>
<p>In giving the history of the well in Chapter I., the writer
did not state the properties of the Woodhall water; but as these
depend upon the geological elements, from which it originates,
this seems to be the proper place to state them.&nbsp; The
official analysis made by Professor Frankland, F.R.S., 1875, is
as follows:&mdash;<a name="citation98c"></a><a

<p>The Woodhall water, therefore, has five times the amount of
iodine, and nearly twice the amount of bromine, of the strongest
known Continental water. <a name="citation99a"></a><a
href="#footnote99a" class="citation">[99a]</a></p>
<p>I mentioned, in Chapter I., that the Dead Sea, in Palestine,
was stronger in bromine than Woodhall.&nbsp; According to M.
Marchand&rsquo;s analysis, it contains bromide of magnesium 74
times the amount at Kreuznach, or about 30 times the strength of
Woodhall; but the other great ingredient of the Woodhall water,
iodine, is absent from the Dead Sea. <a name="citation99b"></a><a
href="#footnote99b" class="citation">[99b]</a>&nbsp; In iodine
the only known water surpassing Woodhall Spa is the spring of
Challes in Savoy, <a name="citation99c"></a><a
href="#footnote99c" class="citation">[99c]</a> which contains
1.045 parts per 100,000 of water.</p>
<p>I may add that at Old Woodhall, about four miles distant from
&ldquo;The Spa,&rdquo; at a depth of 33 feet, in sinking a well,
some 20 years ago, salt water was tapped, resembling in taste
that of the Woodhall Spa well, but it gradually became less salt,
and finally was replaced by a supply of fresh water. <a
name="citation99d"></a><a href="#footnote99d"
class="citation">[99d]</a></p>
<p>There is one other geological feature of the neighbourhood of
Woodhall, which has not yet been touched upon, viz., the Fens
bordering on the Witham.&nbsp; These are said to have been, to
some extent, drained by the Romans; <a name="citation99e"></a><a
href="#footnote99e" class="citation">[99e]</a> but <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>within the last few centuries they have been partially
reclaimed, have relapsed into bog and morass, and been finally
reclaimed for good, in quite recent times.&nbsp; The writer, when
a boy, used to visit a large farmer, living in Blankney Fen,
whose father built the house in which he resided.&nbsp; Before
building, an artificial foundation had to be made, by
transporting soil in boats, or carts, from <i>terra firma</i>
beyond the Fens, the whole Fen tract being more or less bog and
swamp.&nbsp; When this had become sufficiently consolidated, the
house and farm buildings were erected upon it; and from that
centre roads were constructed, drains made, and the work of
reclamation gradually extended.&nbsp; These drains, or
&ldquo;skirths,&rdquo; as they are sometimes called, were
periodically cleaned by a &ldquo;bab,&rdquo; a kind of dredge,
with hooks at its under side to tear up plant roots.&nbsp; Great
flocks of geese were kept, which were plucked alive several times
a year, for the sale of the feathers, to make the famed
Lincolnshire feather beds, and quills for the pens, now rarely
seen, although, 50 years ago, in universal use.&nbsp; Until the
land had become systematically reclaimed, it still continued to
be extensively flooded in the winter months, and all cattle had
to be housed, or penned, during that time, on the artificially
raised ground.&nbsp; It frequently happened that early frosts
caught the farmer napping, with his cattle still afield; in which
case they had to be driven home over the ice, and numbers were at
times &ldquo;screeved,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;split
up,&rdquo; in the process, and had to be slaughtered.&nbsp; The
fen soil is a mass of decayed vegetation, chiefly moss,
interlarded with silt, deposited by the sea, which formerly made
its oozy way as far as Lincoln.&nbsp; Large trees of bog oak and
other kinds are found in the soil.&nbsp; These, it is supposed,
became rotted at their base by the accumulating peat; and the
strong south-west winds, prevailing then as they do now, broke
them off, and they are, in consequence, generally found with
their heads lying in a north-easterly direction.&nbsp; Borings at
different places show the fen soil to vary in depth from 24ft. at
Boston to 14&frac12;ft. at Martindale; but, as it has been
gradually dried by drainage, it has considerably shrunk in
thickness, and buried trees, which only a few years ago were
beyond the reach of plough or spade, are now not uncommonly
caught by the ploughshare.</p>
<p>The river Witham, which the visitor to Woodhall Spa sees
skirting the railway, has passed through more than one
metamorphosis.&nbsp; <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Now confined by banks, which have
been alternately renewed and broken down at different periods,
before the drainage of the Fens, it spread over all that level
tract of country, meandering by its many islands and through its
oozy channels and meres, the resort of countless flocks of wild
fowl and fish <i>ad infinitum</i>, but preserving still one main
navigable artery, by which vessels of considerable tonnage could
slowly sail to Lincoln.&nbsp; Acts were passed, in the reigns of
Edward the Third.&nbsp; Richard the Second, Henry the Seventh,
Queen Elizabeth, and the two Charleses; and Commissioners were
again and again appointed to effect the embanking and draining of
these watery wastes, but with only temporary success; and it was
not till 1787, or 1788, that the present complete system of
drainage was commenced, which is now permanently established. <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a>&nbsp; And in these days, the Fens,
once consisting as much of water as of land, at times even suffer
from a scarcity of that commodity; drains, which within the
writer&rsquo;s own recollection abounded with fish, being now
often dry almost all the year round.&nbsp; At a much more remote
period the Witham was probably a much stronger river, and largely
conduced to altering the features of the county.&nbsp; This
subject has been carefully investigated by our geologists, <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a> with the result that certain changes
in the strata of the upper Witham valley, from its source near
Grantham, and changes also in the lower valley of the Trent, go
far to prove that the Trent, instead of, as it does now, flowing
into the Humber, took a more easterly course, and joining forces
with the Witham some miles above Lincoln, the united streams
pushed their way through the gorge, or &ldquo;break&rdquo; in the
cliff formation, which occurs there, and is technically known as
&ldquo;The Lincoln Gap,&rdquo; and continued their course to the
sea by <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>something like the present channel
of the Witham.&nbsp; The idea of this &ldquo;Lincoln Gap,&rdquo;
though the term is not actually used, would seem to have
originated with Mr. W. Bedford, who stated, in a paper already
mentioned, read before &ldquo;The Lincolnshire Topographical
Society,&rdquo; in 1841, that &ldquo;the great breach below
Lincoln could only be accounted for by the mighty force of
agitated waters dashing against the rocks, through long
ages&rdquo;.&nbsp; (Printed by W. and B. Brookes, Lincoln, 1843,
p. 24, &amp;c.)&nbsp; The theory would seem to be now generally
accepted.&nbsp; Thus: &ldquo;that ancient river, the river&rdquo;
Witham, honoured, we believe, by the Druid as his sacred stream,
<a name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a> consecrated in a later age to the
Christian, by the number of religious houses erected on its
shores, through a yet earlier stage of its existence performed
the laborious task of carving out the vale of Grantham, and so
adding to the varied beauty of our county; then, by a kind of
metempsychosis of the river spirit, it was absorbed in the body
of the larger Trent; the two, like &ldquo;John Anderson, my
Joe,&rdquo; and his contented spouse, &ldquo;climbed the hill
together,&rdquo; to the Lincoln Gap, and hand in hand wended
their seaward way, to help each other, perchance, in giving birth
to the Fenland; or, according to another theory, in making its
bed.&nbsp; Through a long era this union lasted; but, as the old
saying is, &ldquo;the course of true love never did run
smooth&rdquo;; a change geologic came over the scene, and,
through force of circumstance, the <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>two, so
long wedded together, broke the connubial bond, and henceforth
separated, pursuing each their different ways; the one, the
Trent, the river of thirty fountains, betaking herself &ldquo;to
fresh woods and pastures new,&rdquo; after brief dalliance with
the Ouse, became bosomed in the ample embrace of the Humber; the
other, the humbler stream of the two, retaining its previous
course, pursued the even tenor of its way through the flats of
the Fenland, with their &ldquo;crass air and rotten harrs,&rdquo;
to find its consolation in the &ldquo;dimpling smiles,&rdquo; but
restless bosom, of the shallow &ldquo;Boston Deeps.&rdquo;&nbsp;
During the period of that ancient alliance of these two streams
the tract of country between Lincoln and Boston, or rather
between the points now occupied by those places, would be scoured
by a greatly-augmented volume of water, and this may possibly
account in some degree for the shallowness of &ldquo;The
Wash,&rdquo; and the number of submarine sandbanks which lie off
the mouth of the present Witham.&nbsp; Had the union of the two
streams continued to the present time, bringing down their united
body of silt, Boston would either never have come into existence
at all, or would have been much further from the sea than it
is.</p>
<p>The precise period at which this riverine union prevailed
would seem to be still an open question; and we may say, with
Horace, <i>adhuc sub judice lis est</i>; for, whereas Professor
Archibald Geikie, Director-General of the Government Geological
Survey, <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> gives his opinion that &ldquo;the
gravels which have been laid down by an older Trent, that flowed
through the gorge in the Jurassie escarpment at Lincoln, were
later than the glacial deposits&rdquo;; on the other hand, Mr. F.
M. Burton, F.L.S., F.G.S., <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a> who has a
thorough local knowledge of the county and its geological
features, says there is sufficient evidence &ldquo;to convince
any reasonable mind that the present course of the Trent is not
its original one; but that ages ago, in early pre-glacial times,
I think, it passed through the Lincoln Gap to the fenland beyond,
which was then open bay.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may well say with Pope:
&ldquo;Who shall decide when doctors disagree?&rdquo; <a
name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a>&nbsp; This, <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>however, is
too large a subject for a chapter on the geology of Woodhall Spa;
but this brief reference to it may serve to show the visitor, who
has the taste and inclination for such pursuits, that there are
still subjects for interesting investigation in our
neighbourhood, on which he might well employ his capacities for
research.</p>
<h2><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; THE
ARCH&AElig;OLOGY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.</h2>
<p>In entering on this portion of our Records we are passing from
the Natural to the Artificial, from the operations of the Creator
to the works of the creature.&nbsp; A systematic process of
enquiry would shew that, as in geology, so here, the
subject-matter lies in layers.&nbsp; We have the prehistoric
period concerning pal&aelig;olithic and neolithic man; then
follow the British, the Roman, the Saxon, the Danish, and the
Norman strata, or eras; so many have been the elements which have
contributed to the moulding of our country and our people, as we
find them at the present day.&nbsp; But again, as in geology, so
here, we find few traces in our own immediate neighbourhood of
the earlier links in this series&mdash;the people who preceded
the historic Britons.&nbsp; On Twig Moor, near Brigg, in the
north of the county, a tract of ground very similar to our own
Moor, many flint implements have been found.&nbsp; On an
excursion of our &ldquo;Naturalists&rsquo; Union&rdquo; to that
tract, one of the party found &ldquo;a handful&rdquo; of stone
&ldquo;knives and finely-chipped arrow heads.&rdquo; <a
name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; The members of the same
Society, visiting Woodhall in 1893, found on the Moor
&ldquo;patches of pale-coloured sand, slightly ferruginous, and
having a considerable number of flints,&rdquo; but none were
found which could be said to shew traces of human use.&nbsp;
This, however, is no reason why the visitor to Woodhall should
not search for them.&nbsp; That they exist in our neighbourhood
has been proved, since a good specimen of flint axe was found a
few years ago by Mr. A. W. Daft, on Highrigge farm, near
Stobourne Wood, in Woodhall.&nbsp; It is about five inches in
length and 1&frac14; inches broad, and, from its high degree of
polish, probably was the work of neolithic man. <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; Another, smaller, flint celt
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>was found in 1895 by Mr. Crooks, of Woodhall Spa, in
the parish of Horsington, near Lady-hole bridge, between
Stixwould and Tupholme.&nbsp; Its length was 3&frac12; inches, by
2&frac12; inches in breadth, thickness about &frac34; inch.&nbsp;
More recently one was found in a field on the Stixwould road by
his son, about three inches in length and 1&frac12; inches broad,
thickness &frac34; inch.&nbsp; In 1904 several finely chipt flint
arrow heads, about one inch in length and breadth, were found in
the parish of Salmonby, near Horncastle, in a field called
&ldquo;Warlow Camp,&rdquo; doubtless the site of a prehistoric
settlement.&nbsp; The present writer has picked up at odd times
some half dozen specimens, bearing more or less trace of human
manipulation, but none of them so well finished as those referred
to.&nbsp; A farmer residing near the Moor, to whom I recently
explained what a flint implement was, said he had noticed several
stones of that kind, but did not know that they were worth
picking up.&nbsp; Two molar teeth of the Elephas primigenius, or
extinct mammoth, have been found in a pit at Kirkby-on-Bain,
situated between the road and the canal, about a quarter of a
mile north-west of the church; <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a> and bones of Bos
primigenius and Cervus elaphus were found among gravel and
ice-scraped pebbles in a pit, near Langworth bridge (not far from
Bardney).&nbsp; The former of these, the gigantic Ox, or Urus,
belonged to the pal&aelig;olithic age, <a
name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b"
class="citation">[106b]</a> when the first race of human beings
peopled this land, but was extinct in the neolithic period in
this country (though in a later age re-introduced).&nbsp; The
latter, which is our red-deer, survived in a wild state, in our
county and neighbourhood, until comparatively modern times.&nbsp;
Large vertebr&aelig;, apparently of some huge Saurian, have been
found, which the writer has seen, in West Ashby; and a large
mammoth tooth is preserved among the treasures of the late
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute at Horncastle, having been found in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; These are all the pre-historic relics
which I can find recorded in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Later antiquities, of the British, Roman, and succeeding
periods, are, or have been, fairly plentiful; the misfortune
being that, as we, as yet, have no County Museum wherein they
could be preserved, they have doubtless many of them been lost,
or, if kept in private hands, are unrecorded.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>When the bed of the Witham, by order of the Royal
Commissioners, was cleansed in 1788, a number of swords, spears,
arrow heads, etc., were found on the hard clay bottom, which had
been covered over, and so preserved, by the accumulated
mud.&nbsp; And in the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo;
for that year a list of them was given.&nbsp; The late Sir Joseph
Banks, of Revesby Abbey, secured a considerable number of such
relics, catalogues of which are given in &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Notes &amp; Queries,&rdquo; Vols. III. and IV.&nbsp; They consist
of arms and utensils of our British, Roman, Saxon, and Danish
ancestors.&nbsp; Among the more interesting of these was a
whittle, or &ldquo;anelace,&rdquo; exactly resembling one
described by Greene as part of Chaucer&rsquo;s dress. <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; In connection with Woodhall were
the following:&mdash;A sword, probably Saxon, brought up from the
Witham bed near &ldquo;Kirkstead Wath,&rdquo; entangled in the
prongs of an eel-stang.&nbsp; The pommel and guard are tinned, as
we now tin the inside of kitchen utensils; an art which we should
not have known that our forefathers at that period possessed but
for such discoveries as this.&nbsp; The polish still remained on
parts of the blade &ldquo;admirably brilliant.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
bore the inscription + Benvenutus + on one side, and on the other
+ me fecit +, in Saxon characters; the name shewing that the
maker was an Italian, the crosses probably implying that he (or
the owner, if made to order) was a Christian; while from the
Saxon lettering we should infer that the Italian sword-cutler
exercised his craft in the north of Europe.&nbsp; Another sword,
with brass scabbard, of elegant workmanship and richly gilt, was

Roman inscriptions, were also found near Bardney.</p>

class="citation">[108d]</a>&nbsp; A description is given in the
&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia&rdquo; of the Society of Antiquaries
(Vol. XIV.) of an iron candlestick, of curious construction,
being one of six which were found <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>in the
Witham by Kirkstead.&nbsp; We may well imagine that they, at one
time, served to light the refectory of the Abbey, where the monks
of old dispensed hospitality to the poor and needy, or to the
wayfaring stranger.&nbsp; Perhaps the most interesting relic of
all is a British shield, of finely-wrought metal, originally
gilt, with a boss of carnelian, and ornamented with elaborate
devices, shewing that those primitive people, though living a
rude life, had attained to a very considerable degree of skill in
working metals.&nbsp; It is described in the
&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologica&rdquo; (Vol. XXIII.); and an engraving
is given of it in &ldquo;Fenland&rdquo; by Skertchly and Miller
(p. 463).&nbsp; It was formerly in the Meyrick collection.</p>
<p>The above are a selection of the most interesting objects
yielded up to us chiefly by the Witham; there have been many
more, but of less importance.&nbsp; Several Roman urns in
different places have been exhumed.&nbsp; The parish of Thornton
runs down to Kirkstead station, passing almost within a
stone&rsquo;s throw of the Victoria Hotel; and in Thornton a
small Roman vase was discovered when the railroad was made, in
1854.&nbsp; The present writer has seen it, but it has,
unfortunately, disappeared.&nbsp; An engraving and description of
it are given in the &ldquo;Linc. Architectural Society&rsquo;s
Journal,&rdquo; Vol. IV., Part II., p. 200.&nbsp; It was nine
inches in height, of rather rough construction, and with a rude
ornamentation.&nbsp; Two Roman urns, or, according to another
account, six (&ldquo;Lincolnshire N. &amp; Q.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vol.
III., p. 154), were also found at the north-east corner of a
field, on the road leading from Stixwould to Bucknall, about
3&frac12; miles from Woodhall.&nbsp; They were of the kind
technically termed &ldquo;smoke burnt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The soil at
the spot was a clay of so tenacious a character that several
horse-shoes, some of them of a very old and curious make, have
been found in the former quagmire.&nbsp; Several large Roman urns
have been found in, or near, Horncastle, and are preserved among
the treasures of the late Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, having been
presented to the town by the sole surviving trustee, Mr. Joseph
Willson, to form, with other objects, the nucleus of a local
museum at some future time.&nbsp; Engravings of these also are
given, with a Paper by Rev. E. Trollope, the late Bishop
Suffragan of Nottingham, in the abovementioned Journal, at p.
210.</p>
<p>At Ashby Puerorum, so called because certain lands in the
parish go to pay for the choristers of Lincoln Cathedral, in the
year 1794, a labourer, cutting a ditch, discovered, three feet
<!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>below the surface, a Roman sepulture, a stone chest
squared and dressed with much care, in which was deposited an urn
of strong glass of greenish hue.&nbsp; The chest was of
freestone, such as is common on Lincoln heath.&nbsp; The urn, of
elegant shape, contained human bones nearly reduced to ashes, and
among them a small lacrimatory of very thin green glass. <a

<p>On the Mareham road, on the south side of Horncastle, beyond
the Black Swan inn, was a Roman burial ground, and several
cinerary urns and some coffins have been discovered there.&nbsp;
One stone coffin now stands in the back premises of Mr. James
Isle, near to the corner where the Spilsby and Boston roads
meet.&nbsp; In connection with this subject, I may here mention
the most recent arch&aelig;ological &ldquo;find&rdquo; in
Horncastle.&nbsp; While digging gravel in a pit recently opened
in a garden at the back of Queen Street, not far from the Mareham
Road, in 1897, the pick of the labourer struck against a hard
substance, about two feet below the surface, which, on
examination, proved to be an ancient coffin.&nbsp; It was
constructed, except the lid, of one sheet of lead, slit at the
corners to allow its being doubled up to form the sides and
ends.&nbsp; The coffin was 5ft. 2in. in length, and within were
the remains of a skeleton, pronounced by experts to be that of a
female.&nbsp; A few days later a second lead coffin was found,
similar to the former, except that it was 5ft. 7in. long, and the
skeleton was pronounced to be that of a man.&nbsp; Both coffins
lay east and west.&nbsp; The present writer was asked to
investigate the matter.&nbsp; On enquiry, it was found that,
about 24 years before, three lead coffins had been found within
100 yards of the same spot; they were sold for old lead and
melted down. <a name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b"
class="citation">[110b]</a>&nbsp; As Horncastle was the old Roman
station Banovallum, the question arose whether these coffins were
Roman, or of later, date.&nbsp; The orientation of both implied
that they were Christian.&nbsp; After much interesting
correspondence, the writer obtained the information from an
antiquary of <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>note, that if the lead was pure it
would be of post-Roman date, if it contained an admixture of tin
it would most probably be Roman.&nbsp; Analysis of the lead was
made by a professional, which gave &ldquo;percentage of tin 1.65
to 97.08 of lead, 1.3 of oxygen, which implied that the persons
buried were Romans, as well as Christians.&nbsp; A peculiar
feature in these burials was that there were lumps of lime about
the skeletons.&nbsp; I find, however, that some years ago a lead
coffin was discovered near the Roman road, which passes through
the parish of Bow, containing a skeleton with lime. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; From its position near the Roman
road we should infer that this was a Roman burial, and the
presence of lime confirms the origin of the Horncastle
coffins.&nbsp; The lime was probably used as a
preservative.&nbsp; One of the coffins was sold for a collection
in Manchester, the other was bought by public subscription, to be
preserved for a future local museum.&nbsp; In the same gravel
pit, a few days after the finding of the coffins, the
labourer&rsquo;s tool struck against another object, which proved
to be an earthenware vessel, probably a Roman urn, but it was so
shattered that he threw the fragments away, and they could not be
recovered.&nbsp; It was described as being about 10 inches high,
of a brown colour, and bearing traces of a pattern running round
it.</p>
<p>Several old coins have been found in Horncastle, and some at
Tattershall.&nbsp; As to the latter place, Allen, in his
&ldquo;History,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 72, and Weir
(&ldquo;Historical Account of Lincolnshire,&rdquo; vol. i., p.
302), say that several Roman coins have been found, but they do
not specify what they were.&nbsp; There were two so-called
&ldquo;Roman camps&rdquo; in what is called Tattershall Park,
this being supposed to be the Roman station Durobrivis.&nbsp;
But, alas! &ldquo;Jam seges est, ubi Troja fuit&rdquo;: the
plough has eliminated the camps from the field of view.&nbsp;
Roman coins would be a natural result of a Roman station.&nbsp;
It should not, however, be forgotten that Gough, Camden, and
other authorities pronounce these camps to have been of British
origin.&nbsp; The earlier Britons used mainly a brass coinage, or
iron bars (utuntur aut aere, aut taleis ferreis, says
C&aelig;sar, <i>Bell. Gall.</i>, v. 12); so that there should not
be much difficulty in deciding whether the coins were those of
British or Roman occupants.&nbsp; Taught by the Romans, the later
Britons probably coined considerably.&nbsp; The oldest <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>specimens known to be coined at Lincoln bear the name
of King Arthur.&nbsp; Camden and Speed give several.&nbsp; At
Horncastle, the oldest coin found was British, having on one
side, amid mystic circles, the figure of a &ldquo;horse
rampant,&rdquo; indicative of the reverence in which the horse
was held by the Druids. <a name="citation112a"></a><a
href="#footnote112a" class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; Stukeley
says, in his Diary, &ldquo;a coign I got of Carausius found at
Hornecastle.&nbsp; It had been silvered over.&nbsp; The legend of
the reverse is obscure.&nbsp; It seems to be a figure, sitting on
a coat of armour, or trophy, with a garland in her left hand, and
(legend) Victorii Aug.&rdquo; <a name="citation112b"></a><a

Verus, and Faustina the younger, and several more. <a

class="citation">[112c]</a>&nbsp; In December, 1898, a coin was
found by a son of Mr. W. K. Morton, bookseller, while playing in
the garden at Onslow House, which proved to be one of the Emperor
Constantine.</p>
<p>In deepening the bed of the river Bain to form the canal, in
1802, an ornamental brass spur, part of a brass crucifix, and a
dagger, were found together, at a short distance from the north
basin of the canal; and the writer once found, some quarter of a
mile out of Horncastle, on Langton hill, the rowell of a spur,
with very long spikes, probably at one time belonging to a
cavalier at the battle of Winceby.&nbsp; He has also in his
possession a pair of brass spurs, found not far from Winceby,
massive and heavy, the spikes of the rowell being an inch in
length.</p>
<p>Let us now return to Woodhall Spa; and on the way pause for a
moment on the moor.&nbsp; We have already mentioned a curious
character, by name Dawson, but more commonly called
&ldquo;Tab-shag,&rdquo; who, within the memory of the writer and
many more, lived as a kind of squatter, in his sod-built hut,
close to &ldquo;The Tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sort of living fossil
was this individual, short in stature, dark in complexion, and
with a piercing, almost uncanny, eye; roughly clad, and looking
as though he were something of a stranger to soap and
water.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; said <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>love-sick Juliet.&nbsp; Yet the name which clung to
this eccentric person probably had its significance.&nbsp; In one
of the &ldquo;Magic Songs&rdquo; of the Finns (given in
&ldquo;Folklore,&rdquo; vol. i., No. iii., p. 827) a sort of
demon is described as &ldquo;Old Shaggy,&rdquo; &ldquo;the horror
of the land,&rdquo; &ldquo;reared on a heather clump,&rdquo;
&ldquo;living on the lee side of a stone,&rdquo; corresponding
much to the home and haunts of our Tab-shag.&nbsp; Brogden <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a> says &ldquo;Shag-foal&rdquo; means
&ldquo;a hobgoblin supposed to haunt certain places,&rdquo; and a
writer in the &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ological Review&rdquo; (for
January, 1890) says that &ldquo;Shag&rdquo; is an old term for an
elf, or Brownie, or &ldquo;goblin dwarf.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds,
&ldquo;The Hog-boy, or Howe-boy, of the Orkneys, in Lincolnshire
is pronounced Shag-boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old lady, born at the
beginning of the eighteenth century, is quoted, in &ldquo;The
Cornhill Magazine&rdquo; (August, 1882) as saying she had often
heard of fairies and shag boys, but had never seen one herself,
&ldquo;though lasses were often skeart (<i>i.e.</i>, scared,
frightened) at them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the weird-looking figure of
Tab-shag, living in the peculiar way he did, in a kind of
&ldquo;brock,&rdquo; or &ldquo;how,&rdquo; of his own
construction, was not altogether unlike that of one of the
&ldquo;How folk,&rdquo; the &ldquo;little people,&rdquo; believed
in by our superstitious forefathers, and whose memory is
perpetuated in the Folk&rsquo;s glove (digitalis) of our heath;
as he squatted on his &ldquo;faerie-knowe&rdquo; on the lee side
of the old Tower, or roamed over the dreary moor at nightfall to
startle the belated wayfarer.</p>
<p>What may have been the meaning of the other element in his
soubriquet is not so easy to say.&nbsp; There is a Cornish (and
probably British) word &ldquo;Tab,&rdquo; which means turf
(&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ol. Journ.&rdquo; vol. ii., No. 3, p. 199),
and that would suit this dweller on the heath; but it is more
likely that &ldquo;Tab&rdquo; had a reference to the cat,
&ldquo;Tabby&rdquo; being the term for a brindled cat.&nbsp; And
Bishop Harsnet, in his curious book on &ldquo;The Superstitions
of the Day&rdquo; (1605), says a witch, or elf, &ldquo;can take
the form of hare, mouse, or cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby is really a corruption of Tibby, and that is from
Tybalt, the name of puss in the old Beast Epic of the middle
ages.&nbsp; Ben Johnson uses &ldquo;tiberts&rdquo; for cats; and
Mercutio, in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; (Act. iii., sc. 1)
addresses Tybalt, when wishing to annoy him, as &ldquo;Tybalt,
you rat catcher . . .&nbsp; King of cats&rdquo;
(Folk-etymology).</p>
<p>This prowler on the heath might well be likened to pussy
prowling after mice, or higher <!-- page 114--><a

class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; But elfs and bogies have now
vanished from our sylvan glades, as the will o&rsquo; the wisp
has from the fens and marshes, where the present writer has seen
it.&nbsp; Drainage, and schools, and newspapers have banished
alike such phenomena, and the belief in them; and Tab-shag, like
many another equally harmless, and equally perhaps misunderstood,
creature, will soon be forgotten.</p>
<p>One more antiquarian discovery may here be noticed.&nbsp; Much
interest was excited by an ancient canoe which was unearthed near
Brigg, in North Lincolnshire, in the year 1886, while some
excavators were working on the east side of the river
Ancholme.&nbsp; It was constructed out of a single tree, which
must have been a very large oak.&nbsp; It was 48ft. in length;
its width 5ft. at the widest part, and 4ft. at the
narrowest.&nbsp; It had three transverse stays, also cut out of
the solid.&nbsp; It was distant from the present river about 40
yards, lying due east and west, on what must have been a sloping
beach.&nbsp; It was completely buried in a bed of alluvial clay;
one end being 5ft. below the surface, and the other 9ft.
below.&nbsp; It is fully described in an article, written by T.
Tindall Wildridge, in &ldquo;Bygone Lincolnshire&rdquo; (1st
series).&nbsp; The writer gives other instances of similar
discoveries&mdash;in the Medway in 1720, in the Rother (Kent) in
1822, on the Clyde, etc.; various such boats, indeed, have been
found on the Clyde, and, in one case, what is further
interesting, the boat had within it a beautifully-finished stone
celt, thus connecting it with the race of, probably, the later
stone period.&nbsp; Several finds of this kind have occurred in
our own river, the Witham, or near it.</p>
<p>In digging for the foundations of a house in the upper part of
the High Street, Lincoln, some 80 or 90 years ago, a boat was
discovered fastened by a chain to a post, <a
name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a> the spot being several yards higher
than the present level of the Witham; thus showing that, when the
Witham was a tidal river, it rose at times considerably higher
than it does now.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>In 1816 an ancient canoe was found, <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a> some 8 feet below the surface, in
cutting a drain, parallel to the Witham, about two miles below
Lincoln.&nbsp; This, like the Brigg boat, was hollowed out of a
single oak, 38ft. long, and 3ft. at the widest part.&nbsp;
Another was found in 1818, in cutting a drain not far from the
last, but was unfortunately destroyed by the workmen before they
knew what it was.&nbsp; Its length was about the same as that of
the previous boat, but it was 4&frac12;ft. wide.&nbsp; Two more
similar canoes&mdash;&ldquo;dugouts,&rdquo; as they were
technically termed&mdash;were found about the same time in
drain-cutting, in the same vicinity; and one of these was
presented to the British Museum. <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a>&nbsp; The Fen
men used to call their boats &ldquo;shouts,&rdquo; from the Dutch
&ldquo;schuyt,&rdquo; a wherry.&nbsp; They propelled them along
the drains by a long pole, called a &ldquo;poy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
would be too much to say that all these vessels belonged to
pre-historic man, because of the presence in one case of a flint
implement, connecting it with the neolithic period.&nbsp; Such
boats have probably been used by all nations, at early stages of
their existence.&nbsp; The Greek writer Hippocrates, about 400
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, mentions the
&ldquo;monoxyle,&rdquo; or one-tree boat; one has been found in
the Tunhovd Fyord in Norway.&nbsp; The Russians of the 9th
century, in the neighbourhood of Novgorod, used them, laden with
slaves for the market.&nbsp; The Goths of the 3rd century, as
stated by Strabo, swept the Black Sea with them; and Professor
Righ says that they have been used until comparatively modern
times in Scandinavia; but at any rate these found in our fens
belong to a period, apparently, when the fens were not yet
formed, or, at most, were forming.&mdash;<i>Article on the Brigg
Boat in</i> &ldquo;<i>Byegone Lincolnshire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now come to a case nearer home.&nbsp; The visitor who takes
a stroll from the cross roads by St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, along
the Tattershall road, shortly after crossing the pellucid sewer,
will see a large pond on his right, close to a farm yard; and on
the other side, eastward, are two ponds, about 80 yards from the
road.&nbsp; All these ponds are pits dug for clay, which was put
on the somewhat light land to strengthen it.&nbsp; The present
course of the sewer, now running in a straight line due east and
west, from Kirkby lane to the Witham, is artificial.&nbsp; It
formerly pursued a tortuous course, and, on <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>reaching
the Tattershall road, flowed southward along the west side of
that road, past what is now the Abbey Lodge public-house,
dividing into more than one channel on its way to the
Witham.&nbsp; This change was made soon after the Kirkstead
estate passed, by purchase, from the Ellison family to that of
the present proprietor, in the year 1839, when great improvements
were made in the farms; the woods, <a name="citation116"></a><a
href="#footnote116" class="citation">[116]</a> which then reached
from the Moor ground to the Tattershall road, were cleared away,
and much land brought into cultivation which had hitherto been
waste, or forest.&nbsp; In digging for clay some 150 yards
eastward from the road, and about the same distance, or a little
more, south of the present course of the sewer, the labourers
came upon the skeleton of a boat several feet below the
surface.&nbsp; I am not able to discover whether it was a
so-called &ldquo;dug-out,&rdquo; formed from one trunk, or
constructed, as modern boats are, of several planks.&nbsp;
Probably it would be the latter.&nbsp; But its position several
feet below the surface would seem to imply considerable
antiquity; while its mere existence would seem to indicate that
either the sewer was formerly a larger stream than it is now, to
float such a boat, or that the waters of the Witham, when
unconfined by such a bank as the present, extended to this point
inland.&nbsp; A circumstance which confirms the supposition of
the sewer being larger is the fact that about this same place it
is known that there was a mill-dam, and doubtless the stream
turned the mill-wheel.&nbsp; The boat in question may not,
therefore, like some of those previously mentioned, have belonged
to pre-historic man; and yet it might well lay claim to an
antiquity sufficiently hoar to make it a relic of some
interest.&nbsp; But, though so long preserved beneath the
surface, once above ground, it soon perished, and even the memory
of it only remains with a few.</p>
<p>The visitor to Woodhall, who has antiquarian proclivities, may
well spend an enjoyable day at Lincoln, not only for the sake of
seeing the <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Cathedral, which is unsurpassed by
any in the kingdom, or, rather, as has been said by no less an
authority than Ruskin, &ldquo;worth any two others&rdquo;; or of
visiting the Castle, founded by the Conqueror; but there are many
other objects of much interest.&nbsp; One of the most important
discoveries of recent years is the remains of a Roman basilica,
found beneath the house of Mr. Allis, builder, in Bailgate, where
a small fee is charged for admission.&nbsp; This has been
pronounced by an authority, the late Precentor Venables, to have
been &ldquo;the finest Roman building in the
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its length was 250 feet, width 70 feet, and
it had stately pillars rising to a height of 30 feet.&nbsp;
Beyond this is the fine old Newport Arch, the only Roman city
gate in the kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The noblest remnant of this
sort in Britain,&rdquo; says Leland.&nbsp; He will do well to
furnish himself with the &ldquo;Pocket Guide to Lincoln,&rdquo;
by the late Sir Charles Anderson, one of our greatest
authorities, and &ldquo;A Walk through Lincoln,&rdquo; by the
late learned Precentor Venables, a compendium rich in historic
lore.&nbsp; Either of these will prove a valuable Vade mecum, but
the former, perhaps, more for the study, to be perused before his
visit; the latter a manual for the street.</p>
<p>It may be added that, within quite recent years, the visitor
to Lincoln found himself at once, on landing from the train, in
an atmosphere of antiquity, for, on emerging from the station of
the G. N. Railway, he would see over the door of a shop, full of
modern utensils, facing the gate of the station yard, the name
&ldquo;Burrus,&rdquo; Cooper, a genuine Roman patronymic, the
bearer of which we may well suppose to have been a lineal
descendant of some early Roman colonist, settled at Lindum
Colonia, &ldquo;a citizen of no mean city,&rdquo; for Precentor
Venables reminds us (&ldquo;A Walk through Lincoln,&rdquo; p. 9)
it is one (with Colchester and Cologne) of the only three cities
which still preserve, embedded in their names, the traces of
their ancient distinction as Roman colonies.</p>
<p>By way of whetting the appetite for further enquiry, I give
here a succinct catena of historic items, shewing the many
interesting memories which cluster round our ancient cathedral
city.</p>
<p>Lincoln was the British Caer-Lind-coit, the &ldquo;Fortress
(or City) of River and Wood,&rdquo; these being the chief
features of the position; the river, a sacred British stream,
which carved out for itself its channel through &ldquo;the
Lincoln Gap&rdquo;; and the woods (Welsh, or British,
&lsquo;coed,&rsquo; a wood) which stretched far away for <!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>miles around it; of the remains of which De la Prime
says, &ldquo;infinite millions of roots and bodies of trees have
been found, of 30 yards length and above, and have been sold to
make masts and keels for ships . . . as black as ebony, and very
durable.&rdquo; <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; Then, as
the city took the last element of its name from its woods
(coeds), so the people who dwelt around were called Coitani, or
woodmen <a name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a>; corresponding to the name given to
the dwellers in the fens, Gir-vii, or men of the cars.&nbsp;
Lincoln was the royal city of the Coitani.</p>
<p>During the Roman occupation the Britons were
christianized.&nbsp; After the Romans left the country, the
people having, through the long period of peace, almost lost the
art of war, the British chief Vortigern called in the Saxons from
the continent to aid him against the inroads of the Picts and
Scots; and Hengist and Horsa, Saxon chiefs, came with a large
following and settled in the country (circa <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 450).&nbsp; Vortigern, with their
assistance, repelled those northern marauders, and himself
married Rowena, daughter of Hengist, giving to Hengist, in return
for his aid, considerable lands&mdash;&ldquo;multos agros,&rdquo;
says Matthew of Westminster <a name="citation118c"></a><a
href="#footnote118c" class="citation">[118c]</a>&mdash;in
Lindsey.</p>
<p>But these so-called friends soon proved to be enemies, and, in
462, seized London, York, and Lincoln.&nbsp; Vortimer, son of
Vortigern, died and was buried at Lincoln.&nbsp; Vortigern
himself retired into Wales, and was burnt in his castle there, in
485.</p>
<p>Matthew of Westminster records that King Arthur of &ldquo;the
round table&rdquo; pursued a Saxon army as far as Lincoln, having
defeated them, with a loss of 6,000 men, in a wood near
Barlings.</p>
<p>The Saxons, being ultimately victorious, re-introduced
Paganism, the names of their gods still surviving in our
day-names, Tuesday (Tuisco), Wednesday (Woden), Thursday (Thor),
Friday (Friga), Saturday (Seater).</p>

<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 630), and converted Blecca, the

to have been the first stone church in the kingdom, <a

<p>At a later period the Humber formed a highway for the
marauding Danes, who overran the country, and, if in nothing
else, have left their traces in every village-name ending in
&ldquo;by.&rdquo;&nbsp; In their time Lincoln was the first city
of the Pentapolis, or Quinque Burgi, of Fifburg, a league of the
five confederate towns, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester,
and Stamford.&nbsp; Before the Norman Conquest Lincoln was the
fourth city in the kingdom, and during the 11th and 12th
centuries it was one of the greatest trading towns in the
kingdom.&nbsp; The castle was founded by the Conqueror, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1086, being one of four which he
erected at York, Nottingham, Hastings and here; and 166
&ldquo;mansions&rdquo; were destroyed to provide space for it. <a

<p>The Empress Maud, in 1140, took up her residence in Lincoln,
and strongly fortified the castle.&nbsp; It was besieged by
Stephen, who was defeated and made prisoner at the battle of
Lincoln.&nbsp; A prophecy had long been current to this
effect,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first crowned head that enters
Lincoln&rsquo;s walls,<br />
His reign proves stormy, and his kingdom falls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Stephen&rsquo;s restoration he visited Lincoln in triumph,
wearing his crown; but subsequent events verified the
prediction.</p>
<p>At Lincoln, in 1200, William the Lion, of Scotland, did homage
to King John of England.</p>
<p>On the death of Queen Eleanor, the beloved wife of Edward I.,
at Harby, a small hamlet of North Clifton, Notts, the embalmed
body was taken to Westminster for burial, but the viscera were
brought to Lincoln and interred in the Cathedral, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1290.</p>
<p>In 1301 Edward I. held a Parliament in Lincoln, to decide on
sending letters to Rome to Pope Boniface VIII., asserting
England&rsquo;s independence of the Pope.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>In 1305 Edward I. kept his court in Lincoln a whole
winter, and held another Parliament, in which he confirmed the
Magna Charta of King John. <a name="citation120a"></a><a

<p>A Parliament was also held in Lincoln by Edward II., and
another, in his first year, by Edward III.</p>
<p>In 1352 the staple of wool was removed from Flanders to
England; and Lincoln, with Westminster, Chichester, Canterbury,
Bristol, and Hull, was made a staple town <a
name="citation120b"></a><a href="#footnote120b"
class="citation">[120b]</a> for that commodity.</p>
<p>John, of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III., resided in Lincoln
Castle.&nbsp; His son, &ldquo;Henry of Bolingbroke,&rdquo;
afterwards Henry IV., was the only king born in this
county.&nbsp; John of Gaunt married Catherine Swynford, sister of
Chaucer the poet.&nbsp; She and a daughter were interred in the
Cathedral, on the south side of the altar steps.&nbsp; The
royalty of Lincoln Castle was shewn by a shield over a doorway,
bearing the arms of England and France, quarterly, which were
shewn in Buck&rsquo;s engraving, date 1727.</p>
<p>In the year 1386 Richard II. visited Lincoln and held a Court
in the Episcopal Palace.&nbsp; He granted to the Mayor and his
successors the privilege of having a sword carried before them in
civic processions.</p>
<p>Henry VI. visited Lincoln and held a Court at the
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace in 1440.</p>
<p>Henry VII. visited Lincoln in 1486, and was right royally
entertained.</p>
<p>On the dissolution of monasteries <a
name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c"
class="citation">[120c]</a> by Henry VIII., Lincoln became the
headquarters of 60,000 insurgents, who, by the subsequent
&ldquo;Pilgrimage of Grace,&rdquo; made their protest against the
spoliation, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1536.</p>
<p>In 1541 Henry VIII. made a progress to York, and, although he
had called Lincolnshire one of <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>&ldquo;the
most brute and beastly shires in the realm,&rdquo; he, on his
way, visited Lincoln in great state.&nbsp; It is recorded that he
found in the Cathedral Treasury 2,621 ozs. of gold and 4,285 ozs.
of silver, besides jewels of great value.</p>
<p>On the commencement of the Civil Wars between Charles I. and
his Parliament, the King came to Lincoln, where he received
assurances of support from the Corporation and principal
inhabitants.&nbsp; He convened there a meeting of the nobles,
knights, gentry, and freeholders of the county.&nbsp; Lincoln
Castle was taken by the troops of Cromwell, under the Earl of
Manchester, in the year 1644.</p>
<p>James I. visited Lincoln <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1617,
hunted wild deer on Lincoln Heath, touched 50 persons for
&ldquo;the King&rsquo;s evil,&rdquo; attended service in the
Cathedral, and cockfighting at &ldquo;The Sign of the
George.&rdquo; <a name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a></p>
<p>In 1695 William of Orange visited Lincoln, but it is on record
that, being entertained the day before by Sir John Brownlow, at
Belton, &ldquo;the king was exceeding merry there, and drank very
freely, which was the occasion, when he came to Lincoln, he could
take nothing but a porringer of milk.&rdquo; <a
name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b"
class="citation">[121b]</a>&nbsp; In Lincolnshire phrase, he had
been &ldquo;very fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reviewing these historic items, I think we may say, with the
historian Freeman, that Lincoln &ldquo;kept up its continuous
being, as a place of note and importance, through Roman, English,
Danish, and Norman Conquests,&rdquo; and that it has a record of
which we may fairly be proud, as meriting the praise which old
Alexander Necham, in his treatise &ldquo;De divina
Sapientia,&rdquo; bestowed upon it,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Lindisi&aelig; columen Lincolnia, sive columna,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Munifica felix gente, repleta bonis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have said little of the Cathedral.&nbsp; That is, indeed,
too large a subject.&nbsp; The visitor must see it for
himself.&nbsp; I have referred to the opinion of Mr.
Ruskin.&nbsp; His exact words, written at the time of the opening
of the School of Art, to the Mayor, were these: &ldquo;I have
always held, and am prepared against all comers to maintain, that
the Cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece
of architecture in the British islands, worth any two other
cathedrals we have got.&rdquo; <a name="citation121c"></a><a
href="#footnote121c" class="citation">[121c]</a>&nbsp; Viewed in
the distance, from the neighbourhood of Woodhall Spa, its three
towers <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>seem to coalesce into one, almost of
pyramidal form, to crown the hill on which it stands.&nbsp; That
form was once more lofty, and more pointed, for each of the three
towers had a spire.&nbsp; An entry in the Minster Archives
records the fall of the largest&mdash;ruina magn&aelig;
pyramidis&mdash;in 1547.&nbsp; In 1808 the two other lesser
spires were taken down, not without strong remonstrances and much
skirmishing in the public papers and elsewhere, as to the
propriety of the act.&nbsp; The Lincoln people proved themselves
more law-abiding than they had been on a previous occasion, for
when, in 1726, the Chapter had decided to remove them, there was
a very considerable riot, called &ldquo;The Religious Mob,&rdquo;
of which an amusing account was found among some MS.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Tuesday night</i>, <i>Sept.</i> 20,
1726, <i>a mob was raised in Lincoln to hinder the puling down
the</i> 2 <i>west End spirs of the Cathedrall</i>, <i>which was
then began to be puled down it was computed ther was aBout</i> 4
<i>or</i> 500 <i>men</i>.&nbsp; <i>On Wednesday following by
orders of the Marsters of the Church sent an order to the Mayor
and Aldermen desiering them to send a Belman through the town
with this cry</i>, <i>whereas there as Been a Tumult for this</i>
2 <i>or</i> 3 <i>Long Day</i>, <i>upon puling the</i> 2 <i>west
end Spirs of the Cauthed Church of Lincoln</i>, <i>this is to
give satisfaction that they have made a stop&rsquo; and that the
spirs shall be repaired again with all speed</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing this important proclamation &ldquo;the mob with one
accord gave a great shout and said &lsquo;God bless the
King.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emeute terminated with no more serious results than some
headaches the next day, as the beer barrels in the
Chancellor&rsquo;s cellars were broached and drained to the last
drop by the exultant crowd. <a name="citation122"></a><a
href="#footnote122" class="citation">[122]</a></p>
<p>An interesting feature of Lincoln is the ancient
&ldquo;Jew&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; situated on the left hand of
&ldquo;the street which is called strait,&rdquo; on the
&ldquo;Steep Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jews of old, notwithstanding
the scorn with which they were often treated, were persons of no
small consideration to almost all ranks, from the Sovereign
downwards.&nbsp; Their almost instinctive propensity for amassing
wealth gave them a powerful lever for moving any who were in need
of the moneylender; and there were few who were not.&nbsp;
Through them, and sometimes through them alone, the sovereign
could indirectly break the power of his unruly barons, and,
naturally, in <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>a city of commerce such as Lincoln
was, as well as the not unfrequent seat of Parliament, and the
residence of powerful members of the nobility, the Jews were an
important element in the population.&nbsp; Among the &ldquo;Pipe
Rolls&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Public Records,&rdquo; there are
frequent mentions of them; the famous Aaron and his kinsfolk
figuring largely among them.&nbsp; I here give a few brief
extracts taken from those Rolls (31 Henry I.
[1130&ndash;1]&mdash;1 John [1199&ndash;1200]).</p>
<p>William of the Isle renders count of the ferm of Lincolnshire
. . . and (cr.) by payment of King&rsquo;s Writ to Aaron the Jew,
&pound;29 8s. l0d. . . . owes &pound;12 4s. 9d.&nbsp; He renders
count of the same debt in the treasury &pound;2 6s. 9d. new
money, for &pound;2 4s. 9d. blank money, and &pound;10 in two
tallies, and is quits.&mdash;12 Hen. II., Rot. i. mem. i.
Linc.</p>
<p>The Sheriff accounts for the ferm of the counties, And (cr.)
by payment by King&rsquo;s writ to Aaron of Lincoln and Ysaac Jew
&pound;80.&mdash;22 Hen. II., Dorset and Somerset.</p>
<p>Benedict brother of Aaron, and Benedict son of Isaach, and
Benedict son of Jaocb render count of &pound;6 for one mark of
gold to be quits of the pledges of Isaac son of
Comitissa.&mdash;25 Hen. II., City of Lincoln.</p>
<p>The following looks very like Jews leaguing together to
&ldquo;Jew&rdquo; a fellow Jew:&mdash;Brun the Jew owes
&pound;400 of the fine he made with the King at his
transfretation; but they ought to be required from Aaron of
Lincoln, and Ys&aacute;&aacute;c, and Abraham, son of Rabbi, and
Ys&aacute;&aacute;c of Colchester, his sureties, who have
acknowledged that they received those &pound;400 from his
chattels.&mdash;28 Hen. II., Lond. and Midd.</p>
<p>Benedict, brother of Aaron, renders count of &pound;6 for one
mark of gold, to have in peace his mortgage of Barewe
(<i>i.e.</i>, Barrow).&nbsp; Abraham, son of Aaron, owes &pound;6
for one mark of gold to have his debts (settled).&mdash;29 Hen.
II., Linc.</p>
<p>Brun the Jew renders count of &pound;1,000 out of the 2,000
marks of the fine he made with the King, and of which Aaron of
Lincoln has to answer for 500 marks.&mdash;30 Hen. II., Lond.</p>
<p>The following again looks suspiciously like a bit of Jewish
sharp practice:&mdash;Jacob, sister&rsquo;s son of Aaron, and
Benedict his son, owe one mark of gold, because they kept back
the charters of Benedict of the Bail, which had been
acquitted.&mdash;31 Hen. II., Linc.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as a succeeding entry, we find
that:&mdash;Benedict of the Bail owes 4 bezants, for him, and for
fat Manasses, and Vives son of Deulcresse, and Josoe, son of
Samuel, to have <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>their charters from Benedict, son of
Jacob, and from Jacob, sister&rsquo;s son of Aaron.&mdash;31 Hen.
II., Linc.</p>
<p>But, after all, honesty is the best policy, as shewn in the
result of crafty dealing, in the following:&mdash;Benedict, son
of Aaron, owes 20 marks for right to &pound;4 8s. 8d., against
Meus the Jew of Lincoln; where Benedict has to pay more than
three times the amount of the debt to obtain it.</p>
<p>The following seems to point to a playful practical
joke:&mdash;Jacob, Aaron&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son, renders
count of 20 marks, for an amerciament, for taking off a
priest&rsquo;s cap, and for the deed of Gerard de
Sailby.&mdash;33 Hen. II., Linc.</p>
<p>Aaron Jew, of Lincoln, Abraham son of Rabbi, and Isaac of
Colchester, owe &pound;400 of the chattels of Brun the Jew, which
they received in old money, of the fine which he made with the
King at his crossing over the straits (otherwise called his
&ldquo;transfretation&rdquo;).&mdash;1 Ric. I., Lond. and
Weston.</p>
<p>Of the debts of Aaron of Lincoln, 430 are named, amounting to
about &pound;1,500, a very large sum in those days.&mdash;Rolls,
3&ndash;5 Ric. I.</p>
<p>Here again we have a case of Jewish trickery:&mdash;Ursell,
son of Pulcella, owes 5 marks because he did not give up to Ysaac
his debt, and Matathias the Jew owes half a mark because he has
confessed what he previously denied.&mdash;3 Ric. I., Linc.</p>
<p>In the time of Richard I. anti-semitic feeling ran high.&nbsp;
In a Roll, 3 Ric. I., Chent (Kent), we find:&mdash;The town of
Ospringe owes 20 marks because it did not make a hue and cry for
a slain Jew.&nbsp; In another, 4 Ric. I., we find:&mdash;Richard
Malebysse renders count for 20 marks, for having his land again,
which had been seized in the hand of the king on account of the
slaughter of Jews at York.&nbsp; William de Percy, Knight, Roger
de Ripun, and Alan Malekuke owe 5 marks for the same.&nbsp; In
Lincoln, however, it has been generally supposed that the Jews
escaped violent treatment, but in a Roll, 3 Ric. I., Linc., there
is a list of 80 names of men of the city fined, as
&ldquo;amerciament for assault on the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several more mentions of transactions of Lincoln
Jews, but these will suffice.&mdash;&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ol.
Review,&rdquo; Vol. ii., No. vi., pp. 398&ndash;410.</p>
<p>There were at one time 52 churches in Lincoln besides the
Cathedral; now they number 15.&nbsp; There were also in the city
14 monasteries.&nbsp; Honorius, the fifth Archbishop of
Canterbury, <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>was consecrated by Paulinus in
Lincoln, in 627.</p>
<p>Services in some of the churches have been held somewhat
irregularly even in this cathedral city, for in answer to queries
from the Bishop in 1743, it was found that in St. Bennet&rsquo;s
there was divine service once a month, and twice on the greater
festivals.&nbsp; St. Mark&rsquo;s had services on the three
greater festivals, and four times a year besides.&nbsp; St.
Martin&rsquo;s had services four or five times a year, St. Mary
le Wigford once every Sunday.&nbsp; An epitaph in the churchyard
of the last-named church, on an old tombstone, a specimen of
Lindocolline wit, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lies one&mdash;believe it, if you
can&mdash;<br />
Who, though an attorney, was an honest man. <a
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have only to add that when Remigius of Fecamp, the first
Norman Bishop, presided over the See of Lincoln, his diocese was
far the largest in England, extending from the Humber to the
Thames, and embracing no less than eight counties.&nbsp; It was
reduced to something like its present dimensions on the
appointment of Bishop Kaye in 1827; except that, since then, a
portion has been taken off and included in the new Diocese of
Southwell.&nbsp; Truly our bishops were princes in those olden
times.</p>
<p>Yet, interesting as Lincoln is, to the arch&aelig;ologist one
thing is lacking, viz., a fitting museum, wherein to bring
together, tabulate, and conserve the many precious relics of the
past, which are now scattered about in private hands, and liable
to all sorts of accidents.&nbsp; When we visit such collections
as those in the museums at Newcastle or Nottingham&mdash;even the
limited and crowded, but very interesting, one at Peterborough,
and, above all the very fine collection (especially of Roman
antiquities) at York&mdash;we are tempted to exclaim, with a sigh
of regret, &ldquo;O! si sic omnes!&rdquo;&nbsp; At Lincoln,
colossal fortunes have been, made in the old &ldquo;staple
city,&rdquo; now vastly grown, and growing, in its trade; will
not some one, or more, of her wealthy sons come forward, and
build, and endow, a museum worthy of the place, and while there
are yet so many priceless treasures available to enrich it?&nbsp;
The Corporation, indeed, have, in the year of grace 1904,
commenced at last a movement toward establishing a county museum,
but no site is yet secured for it.&nbsp; A few objects, chiefly
of Natural History, are already placed for safety in the Castle,
till better accommodation can be provided.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>We now return to some remains, possessing considerable
antiquarian interest, in our neighbourhood, within easy reach for
the visitor to Woodhall Spa, and belonging to a period later than
that of the Briton, or Roman, or even the Saxon and the Dane;
when, as the poet says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Another language spread from coast to coast,<br />
Only perchance some melancholy stream,<br />
Or some indignant hills old names preserve,<br />
When laws, and creeds, and people, all are lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name Woodhall implies the existence, at one time, of a
hall in a wood, and that of sufficient importance to give its
name to the whole demesne. <a name="citation126a"></a><a
href="#footnote126a" class="citation">[126a]</a>&nbsp; Of such a
building we have the traces.</p>
<p>The reader of these pages will have learnt that Woodhall Spa
is but a modern creation, in what was, not long ago, an outlying
corner of the parish from which it gets its name.&nbsp; The
original village of Woodhall, comprising a few scattered
farmhouses and cottages near the church, is distant some four
miles from the Spa.&nbsp; The church will be more fully described
in another chapter; it is here merely referred to as a landmark
in connection with this &ldquo;hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately
adjoining the churchyard, on the south and south-east, are a
farmhouse and buildings of no great age; but directly south of
these, and within 150 yards of the church, is the site of the
ancient Wood-Hall.&nbsp; There is the hollow of a former moat,
enclosing an area of about 120 feet by 90 feet, and beyond this
can be traced the channel of a dike, which would seem to have
connected the moat with a small, but limpid, stream, <a
name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b"
class="citation">[126b]</a> locally called, by the Norse term,
&ldquo;beck,&rdquo; which rises in the gravel, some mile and a
half distant eastward, in the parish of Thornton, not far from
Langton hill; and which, passing Woodhall, finds its way, by
Poolham and Stixwould, into the Witham.&nbsp; Covering a space of
some two acres, there are mounds, beneath which, doubtless, was
the <i>debris</i> of what must, in their day, have been extensive
buildings.&nbsp; They are dotted about with <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>gnarled
hawthorns of considerable antiquity; but otherwise the wood is
now conspicuous only by its absence.</p>
<p>Mr. Denton says (&ldquo;England in the 15th Century,&rdquo; p.
252, Bell &amp; Sons, 1888), &ldquo;the ancient hall or manor
house was usually moated for the purpose of defence,&rdquo; in
times which were apt to be lawless; and in the case of the
&ldquo;Moated Grange&rdquo; connected with a greater religious
house, there was the further advantage of the ready supply of
fish for the restricted diet of the monks, amongst whom, except
for sick members, animal food was prohibited.</p>
<p>I have said that the Wood-Hall, or Hall in the Wood, must have
been sufficiently important to give its name to the
demesne.&nbsp; It may be doubted, however, whether the name
Woodhall has always applied to the whole parish, now so
called.&nbsp; In Camden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; written
about 1586, Gibson&rsquo;s Edition being 1695, although the names
of all the adjoining parishes appear in his map, that of Woodhall
is absent, <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a> and in its place we find
&ldquo;Buckland.&rdquo;&nbsp; This latter name still survives in
&ldquo;Buckland lane,&rdquo; given in the Award Map, in the north
of the parish, and near to which, within the writer&rsquo;s
memory, there remained a tract of waste, and wild woodland.&nbsp;
This name, therefore, is interesting, as indicating the former
presence of the wild deer in our neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is, as
it were, the still uneffaced &ldquo;slot&rdquo; of the roaming
stag,&mdash;a footprint in the sand of time, still visible.&nbsp;
And, since this Buckland lane leads to nowhere beyond itself, we
may well imagine it to have been a sort of <i>cul-de-sac</i>, a
sylvan retreat, in which especially the antlered herds did
congregate from the larger wood of the Manor Hall; and, in
connection with this, we may notice that, not far from this lane,
there still remain two woods, named Dar-wood, which may be taken,
by an easy transition, to represent Deer-wood; further indicating
the wild forest character of the demesne.&nbsp; Buckland lane
terminates at a small enclosure, now known, for some unrecorded
reason, as &ldquo;America,&rdquo; the sole plot of land, besides
the churchyard, remaining in the parish attached to the
church.&nbsp; The modern incumbent may indulge his fancy by
supposing that, notwithstanding <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the strict
monastic rule, this bit of church land may, in the olden day,
occasionally have furnished a &ldquo;fatte buck&rdquo; for the
table of the lordly Abbot of Kirkstead. <a
name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a"
class="citation">[128a]</a>&nbsp; In the Liber Regis, or
King&rsquo;s Book, issued by Commissioners under Henry VIII., the
benefice is called Wood Hall; but it would seem, from what has
been given above, that it was not until a later period that the
whole Civil Parish became known by that name.&nbsp; There is
nothing to show who were the occupants of this Wood Hall, but,
until the Reformation, they probably held it in fee from the
Abbots of Kirkstead.&nbsp; One little evidence of the connection
with the great religious house survived, till within the last few
years, in the Holy Thistle (Carduus Marianus), which grew in an
adjoining field, as it also did about the ruin of Kirkstead
Abbey, but it is now, it is believed, extinct.&nbsp; The monks
found an innocent recreation in gardening, but they are gone, and
even their plants have followed them.</p>
<p>In this same parish, and within two miles of this old Wood
Hall, are the traces of another similar ancient establishment,
viz., High-hall.&nbsp; We have already stated that Brito, son of
Eudo, the Norman Baron of Tattershall, gave to the Abbots of
Kirkstead two portions of the parish of Woodhall, which would
seem to imply that he retained the third portion for himself. <a
name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a>&nbsp; In that case this residence of
the superior Lord of the Manor might naturally be distinguished
from the Wood Hall by the title of the High Hall; and the traces
of it which remain indicate that it was on a larger scale than
the former.&nbsp; The position is in the second field northward
from the road called &ldquo;&lsquo;Sandy lane,&rdquo; which is
the boundary between the Woodhall Spa Civil district and Old
Woodhall, and just outside, westward, the present High-hall Wood,
which <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>formerly extended further than it
now does, so as completely to shelter this hall from the north
and east.&nbsp; There are traces of three moated enclosures, from
70 yards to 100 yards in length east and west, and from 40 yards
to 60 yards in width, covering an area of some three acres.&nbsp;
Here, also, as at Woodhall, the moats, for the sake of fresh
water, are connected by a channel with a running stream near at
hand, though now at this point only small, named Reed&rsquo;s
Beck, which rises within the High-Hall Wood.</p>
<p>At what date this old Hall fell into decay we have no means of
knowing.&nbsp; The turf which now covers its foundations has at
some time been levelled, and beyond slight indications of walls
in the central of the three enclosures, the moats alone survive
to shew its extent.&nbsp; The writer is in possession of an
interesting relic, an old pistol of curious workmanship, which
was found near the place by Mr. Atkinson, of the farm adjoining,
in digging a ditch.&nbsp; The peculiar make of the weapon would
seem to indicate that it was of the date of about Charles I.; <a
name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a> in which case we may suppose that the
Hall was at that time occupied as a residence, and the pistol,
being of French manufacture and rather handsomely chased, may
have belonged to the wealthy occupant of the mansion; or, perhaps
more likely, may have been part of the accoutrements of a
cavalier of rank in the Royalist army, which, after their defeat
at the battle of Winceby, near Horncastle, Oct. 11, 1643, was
dispersed over the whole of this neighbourhood; and a fugitive
officer may have sought shelter and hospitality at the
High-Hall.</p>
<p>It is not a little remarkable that there should have been
these two Halls, so near to each other and within the one parish;
but they represent to us the lay, and the ecclesiastical, powers
that were.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

residences in our immediate neighbourhood, but in this chapter I
confine myself to the two situated in Woodhall.&nbsp; The others
will claim attention hereafter.</p>

ARCH&AElig;OLOGY&mdash;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>It was stated in the preceding chapter, that, besides the two
ancient moated mansions in the parish of Woodhall, there
described, there are other remains of a like character in our
immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; I will first mention a residence,
the site of which I have not been able definitely to fix, but it
would probably be somewhere near the Manor House of Woodhall
Spa.&nbsp; I have before me a copy of a will preserved at the
Probate Office, Lincoln, <a name="citation131"></a><a
href="#footnote131" class="citation">[131]</a> which begins
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The 6th of Dec., 1608, I, Edmund Sherard of
Bracken-End, in the parish of Woodhall, and county of Lincoln,
gente., sicke in bodye, but of perfect memorie, do will,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; We may pause here to notice that the name
&ldquo;Bracken-End&rdquo; would seem to imply that the residence
stood at an extreme point of what is now &ldquo;Bracken&rdquo;
wood, and, as the position would naturally be viewed in its
geographical relation to the centre of the parish, either to the
Woodhall by the parish church, or to the manorial High Hall, this
point, we may assume, would be on the far, or south, side of
Bracken wood, as the present Manor House is.&nbsp; In a similar
manner a row of houses in Kirkstead, from their outlying
situation, are called &ldquo;Town-end.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an old
document, in Latin (Reg. III., D. &amp; C.D. 153), mention is
made of &ldquo;Willelmus Howeson de Howeson-end&rdquo;; and the
residence of Lord Braybrooke, in Cambridgeshire, is named Audley
End.&nbsp; There are known to have been a succession of buildings
on the site of the present Woodhall Manor House, and we can
hardly doubt that the residence here referred to as
&ldquo;Bracken-end&rdquo; also stood there.</p>
<p>The will is of further interest as shewing the
testator&rsquo;s connection and dealings with members of families
of position once, or still, well known in the neighbourhood or
county.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>His first bequest is (that which is the common lot of
us all) &ldquo;my bodye to the earth whence it came.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He then goes on to bequeath certain sums &ldquo;To Susanna my
weif . . .&nbsp; To Elizabeth Sherard my daughter . . .&nbsp; To
my sonne Robert . . .&nbsp; To the child my weif is conceaved
with . . .&nbsp; The portions to be payde when my son Robert is
xxj. years of age, and my daughters&rsquo; portions when they are
xx., or shall marrie.&nbsp; My executur to keepe and maintaine my
children,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; He then wills that, in accordance
with &ldquo;an arbitrament between Sir John Meares, of Awbrowy
(Aukborough), in the county of Lincoln, knight,&rdquo; and
another, &ldquo;with the consent of Willm. Sherard, of
Lope-thorpe, in the parish of North Witham, knight, on the one
partie, and I, the said Edmund Sherard, of the other partie . . .
that the said William Sherard shall be accomptable . . . every
yeare, of the goods and chattles of John Sherard, late of
Lincoln, gent., deceased&rdquo; . . . and, &ldquo;I desire my
said brother William Sherard, knight, . . . that he should
discharge the same accordinglie to the benefit of my weif and
children.&nbsp; Item, that Robert Thomson, my Father-in-law,
shall have all my sheepe in Bracken End, which I bought of him,
and owe for only fourty of them; that he shall paye to my wief
for them vs. iiijd. (5s. 4d.) apeece.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
mentions as &ldquo;debts dewe&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;John Ingrum of
Bucknall for sheepe of lord Willoughbie xijli.; Edward Skipwith
of Ketsby, gent, for lx. sheep xxvvijli.; and if he refuse the
sheepe, to pay to my executrix xls., which the Testator payde for
sommering them: Edward Skipwith to be accomptable for the wool of
the sayde sheepe for this last year, but (<i>i.e.</i>, except)
for vli. he hath payde in parts thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Lord Clinton oweth for 1000 kiddes.&nbsp; Thomas Brownloe,
servant of lord Willoughbie of Knaith, oweth for monev lent him,
lvs.&rdquo;&mdash;Prob. at Lincoln 9 Jan. 1608&ndash;9.</p>
<p>On these various items we may remark that, from the figures
here given, 60 sheep cost 27 pounds, or 9 shillings each, of the
money of that date, and for the &ldquo;sommering&rdquo; of them
was paid 8d. each.&nbsp; In the first case his father-in-law was
only able to pay 5s. 4d. each, because the testator still owed
him for 40 of them.</p>
<p>The Lord Clinton named as owing for &ldquo;1000 kiddes&rdquo;
would at that time be residing at Tattershall Castle, which was
one of his principal residences, Sempringham being another
(Camden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p. 478).&nbsp; We here
have the thoroughly Lincolnshire word <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&rdquo;kid&rdquo; for faggot. <a
name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; The name
&ldquo;Lope-thorpe&rdquo; for the residence of the
testator&rsquo;s brother, Sir William Sherard, is a variation
from Lobthorpe.&nbsp; A moat and fish ponds still mark the site
of Lobthorpe Hall in North Witham, and there are several
monuments in the church of Sir Brownlow Sherard and other members
of the family.&nbsp; As there is no mention of the burial of this
Edmund Sherard, Gent., of Bracken-end, in the Woodhall parish
register, he was doubtless also interred at North Witham.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Sir John Meares of Aukborough&rdquo; mentioned as a
party to the &ldquo;arbitrament&rdquo; was a member of a very old
Lincolnshire family, whose chief seat was Kirton near Boston, Sir
John being lord of that manor; and there are several monuments of
the family in the church there.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Meares, of
Meres, was M.P. for Lincoln in eleven Parliaments, and was
knighted at Whitehall in 1660 by Charles II.; and another Thomas
Meeres was Member for the county in three Parlaiments temp. Henry
VI.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Edward Skipwith, of Ketsby, Gent.,&rdquo;
also mentioned, is again a scion of one of our very old county
families, their chief seat in this neighbourhood having been
South Ormsby, to which Ketsby is attached.&nbsp; The church there
has a brass of Sir William Skipwith, Knight, his wife (who was a
Dymoke) and children.&nbsp; Among the &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Gentry&rdquo; of 1634 <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>named in a list preserved in the
library of the Herald&rsquo;s College, are Robert Sherard of
Gautby, and John Sherard; Robert Meeres of Kirton, and Anthony
Meeres of Bonby; Edward Skipwith of Legbourne, Edward Skipwith of
Grantham, and Samuel Skipwith of Utterby.</p>
<p>In the person, then, of this former squire of Bracken-end in
Woodhall, we have an individual belonging to a family of knightly
rank, his friends being members of some of our oldest county
aristocracy, and his transactions connected with such Lords
paramount as the Baron Willoughby of Knaith and Lord Clinton of
Tattershall.&nbsp; I may add that the family is now represented
by Lord Sherard of Leitrim, in the Peerage of Ireland, who is
connected by marriage with the Reeves of Leadenham, the
Whichcotes, and other good Lincolnshire families.</p>
<p>I now proceed to mention a few more of the ancient moated
mansions in our neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was mentioned in the last
chapter that, besides two portions of the land of the parish of
Woodhall being given by Baron Brito, son of Eudo of Tattershall,
to the Abbey of Kirkstead, the rectory of that benefice was also
in the gift of the Abbot.&nbsp; In like manner the Abbot held
lands in Thimbleby, erected a gallows there on which, at
different times, several persons were hanged; and he owned the
advowson of that benefice; and the present rectory house of that
parish, built about 1840, stands on the site of a former
residence, which was guarded by a moat.&nbsp; Within this
enclosure there is still an ancient well, lined with Spilsby
sandstone, of which the church, like most in the neighbourhood,
is also built.&nbsp; This well has been said to be
&ldquo;Roman,&rdquo; <a name="citation134"></a><a
href="#footnote134" class="citation">[134]</a> but, without
venturing to give it so early a date, we may, perhaps, safely say
that it belonged to the lesser religious house formerly there
existing, as a dependency of the Abbey of Kirkstead.&nbsp; There
was, however, a Roman well found a few years ago, at Horncastle,
within the old Roman castle walls, at the spot where the National
Schools now stand.&nbsp; Similarly, the Abbot of Kirkstead was
patron of the benefice of Wispington, another neighbouring
parish, by the gift (about 1400) of another and later descendant
of Eudo of Tattershall, who owned <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>a moiety of
this parish, the Bishop of Durham holding the other moiety; and,
accordingly, here again there are extensive moats, ponds, and
mounds, indicating a former large, and strongly protected,
residence.&nbsp; Portions of this still form parts of a farmhouse
(Mr. Evison&rsquo;s), and the farm buildings on the same
premises, as well as of those now occupied by Mr. Gaunt, whose
very name carries us back to the days of the great Norman
magnate, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, scarcely less powerful
than his ancestor, Gilbert de Gaunt, to whom the Conqueror gave
no less than 113 manors; but to John belonged the peculiar
distinction of being father of Henry IV., the only sovereign born
in our county.&nbsp; This mansion was for some generations the
property of a family of substance, named Phillips.&nbsp; The head
of this family, in the reign of Elizabeth, is mentioned among
those patriotic individuals who subscribed his &pound;25 towards
the cost of the Fleet which was intended to repel the Spanish
Armada.&nbsp; One of this family, Phillips Glover, who was
sheriff for the county in 1727, had a daughter Laura, who married
Mr. Robert Vyner, of Eathorpe, Warwickshire, whose family are now
amongst our greatest landowners, and draw an almost princely
revenue from the Liverpool docks.</p>
<p>We now pass on to another neighbouring moated mansion.&nbsp;
About 2&frac12; miles from Woodhall Spa to the east, and only
separated from Woodhall parish by a green lane, is White-Hall
wood; on the opposite, northern, side of this lane being the
High-Hall wood, already mentioned.&nbsp; Both these woods take
their names from the old residences contiguous to them.&nbsp; The
visitor to Woodhall Spa, if a pedestrian, leaving the road from
Woodhall Spa to Horncastle, in that part of it called
&ldquo;Short lane,&rdquo; because it is so long; after passing
the two small woods, called Roughton Scrubs, on his right hand,
and just before reaching the slight ascent near Martin bridge,
may take to a cart-track, on the left or north side of the road,
through a wood, crossing the railway, which here runs almost
close to the road; pursuing this track through the wood some 200
yards, and then, turning slightly to the left in a north-westerly
direction through two small grass fields, he will find, in an
angle on the north side of the wood, a moated enclosure, between
75 and 80 yards square, shewing slight irregularities of the
ground, on its northern side, indicating the site of a former
building.&nbsp; Outside the moat are <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>traces of
another enclosure; a large depression shews where there was
probably a &ldquo;stew pond&rdquo; for carp and tench; and the
channel of a dyke is seen running north-west till it joins a
small ditch, which may probably, at one time, have been a feeder
to one of two streams already mentioned as being near the High
Hall remains, and named &ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s beck.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
may say here, once for all, that the moats and ponds of these
large establishments were a matter of considerable importance and
care.&nbsp; They were protected from injury by the Acts, 3 Ed. I.
and 5 Eliz., c. 21 (Treatise on Old Game Laws, 1725).&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fish-stews were scientifically cultivated, and so
arranged that they could be drained at will.&nbsp; When the water
was run off from one, the fish were transferred to the
next.&nbsp; Oats, barley, and rye grass were then grown in it;
when these were reaped it was re-stocked with fish.&nbsp; The
ponds were thus sweetened and a supply of food introduced;
suitable weeds were also grown on the margin, and each pond, or
moat, was treated in the same way in
rotation.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nature and Woodcraft,&rdquo; by J.
Watson.</p>
<p>Nothing now exists of this former mansion above ground, but
the moats and mounds cover an area of more than two acres,
shewing that it was a large residence.&nbsp; It is in Martin
parish.&nbsp; Within the writer&rsquo;s recollection there were
marigolds and other flowers still growing about the spot,
survivals from the quondam hall garth, or garden.&nbsp; This was
the home of a branch of the Fynes, or Fiennes Clinton, family,
whose head, Edward, Lord Clinton and Saye, Lord High Admiral of
England, was created Earl of Lincoln by Queen Elizabeth in 1572;
the present head of the family being the Duke of Newcastle, whose
creation dates from 1756.</p>
<p>The connection of this great family with our neighbourhood
came about in this wise.&nbsp; The line of Lord Treasurer
Cromwell having become extinct, Henry VII., in 1487, granted the
manor and other estates to his mother, Margaret, Countess of
Richmond, and in the following year entailed them on the Duke of
Richmond.&nbsp; The Duke died without issue; and Henry VIII., in
1520, granted them to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.&nbsp; On
the death of the two infant sons of the Duke, surviving their
father only a short time, the estates again reverted to the
Sovereign; and in 1551 Edwd. VI. granted them to Edward Lord
Clinton and Saye, afterwards, as we have said, Earl of
Lincoln.&nbsp; These estates included that of the dissolved Abbey
of Kirkstead, and other properties in this neighbourhood; <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>and among them the White Hall and its
appurtenances.&nbsp; When the earldom of Lincoln, through a
marriage, became absorbed in the Dukedom of Newcastle, several of
these estates remained with junior branches of the Clinton, or
Fiennes, family.&nbsp; Of the particular branch residing at White
Hall, probably the most distinguished member was one whose
monumental tablet is still in Roughton church; the ministrations
of which church they would seem, judging by entries in the
registers, to have attended, in preference to the church of
Martin, in which parish the estate was situated.&nbsp; The
lengthy inscription on this tablet is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Here lies the body of Norreys Fynes, Esq.,
Grandson to Sir Henry Clinton, commonly called Fynes, eldest son
of Henry Earl of Lincoln, by his Second Wife, Daughter of Sir
Richard Morrison, and Mother of Francis Lord Norreys, afterwards
Earl of Berkshire.&nbsp; He had by his much-beloved and only Wife
Elizabeth, who lies by him, Twelve children, of which Four Sons
and Two Daughters were living at his decease, which happened on
the 10th of January 1735&ndash;6 in the 75th year of his
age.&nbsp; From the Revolution he always liv&rsquo;d a Non-juror,
<a name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a> which rendered him incapable of any
other Publick Employment (tho&rsquo; by his Great Ability and
Known Courage equal to the most Difficult and Dangerous) than
that of being Steward to two great Familys, wherein he
distinguish&rsquo;d himself during his service of 40 year a most
Faithful and Prudent manager, of a most Virtuous and Religious
Life.&nbsp; His paternal estate he left without any addition to
his son Kendal his next heir.&nbsp; His eldest son Charles was
buried here <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the 26th August 1722, aged 36 years,
whose Pleasant Disposition adorn&rsquo;d by many virtues which he
acquired by his Studys in Oxford made his death much lamented by
all his Acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly, as being a
Non-juror, he may have thought it best not to attend public
worship in his own parish church at Martin, and so have gone,
with his family, to the church of Roughton, where, as an
&ldquo;outener,&rdquo; he would be asked no questions.&nbsp; I
find in connection with his family the following notices in the
Roughton Registers, the spelling of which would certainly shew
that the writer was not a
&ldquo;Beauclerk&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;1722 Mr. Charles fines
burried Augst ye 26. 1722&rdquo;; &ldquo;Madame Elizabeth fines
was buered May ye 29, 1730&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the &ldquo;only
and much loved wife&rdquo; of Norreys Fynes, and the title
&ldquo;Madame&rdquo; was a recognition of her superior
rank.&nbsp; &ldquo;Norreys Fynes Esq. was buried ye 10th January
1736/7&rdquo;&nbsp; This entry was evidently so correctly made by
the Rector himself; as also was probably the next one,
&ldquo;Dormer Fynes ye sonn of Kendall Fynes Esq. and Frances his
wife was baptized Nov. 10. 1737.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cendal
(Kendal) fins, the son of Norreys fins was buried June the twenty
foorst, 1740.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Note the Lincolnshire pronunciation
&ldquo;foorst&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;Francis Fynes, widow of
Kendall Fynes buried May 13. 1752.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous chapter the very bad condition of
the roads about here; and there is a still lingering tradition
that the last of the Fynes residing at White Hall used to drive
about in a waggon drawn by bullocks.&nbsp; This estate, with some
other land, of which the writer has been &ldquo;shooting
tenant&rdquo; for more than a score of years, is still in the
hands of &ldquo;the Fiennes Clinton Trustees&rdquo;; but there
are Fynes, still in the flesh, living in our midst at Woodhall,
who, though treading a humbler walk in life, are not altogether
unworthy of their high ancestry. <a name="citation138"></a><a
href="#footnote138" class="citation">[138]</a></p>
<p>There is another old moated residence, of considerable
historic interest, which next claims our attention.&nbsp; Within
a mile westward of the Wood Hall, by the church, and closely
contiguous to the north-west boundary of the Woodhall estate,
stands Poolham Hall, an old-fashioned, but <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>comfortable
and substantially-built, stucco-coated and slated
farmhouse.&nbsp; It now, along with the small manor, belongs to
Dr. Byron, residing in London, who bought it a few years ago from
Mr. Christopher Turnor, of Stoke Rochford and Panton Hall, in
this county.&nbsp; At the back of the Hall, at the south-west
corner of what is now the kitchen garden, and close to the
enclosing moat, are the remains of a small chapel, consisting of
an end wall and part of a side wall, each with a narrow window;
there are fragments of larger stones bearing traces of sculpture,
and, within recollection, there was also a tombstone with the
date 1527, and a font. <a name="citation139"></a><a
href="#footnote139" class="citation">[139]</a>&nbsp; The house
was, doubtless, formerly much larger than it is now.&nbsp; Like
the other similar residences which I have described, Poolham Hall
has close by it a running stream, called Monk&rsquo;s dyke, which
unites with some of the other becks already named, and ultimately
flows into the Witham.&nbsp; The chief interest in this old place
lies in the distant past; it has gone through a varied series of
vicissitudes, and witnessed some stirring scenes.&nbsp; Weir, in
his &ldquo;History of Horncastle&rdquo; (ed. 1820, p. 58), under
the head of Edlington, says briefly of Poolham, &ldquo;anciently
called Polum, it formed part of the Barony of Gilbert de Gaunt,
until about the 35th year of Edward I., when Robert de Barkeworth
died seised of it; and it appears to have been the residence of
Walter de Barkeworth, who died in 1374, and was buried in the
cloister of Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp; Afterwards it was the
residence of the family of Thimbleby, a branch of the Thimblebys
of Irnham, who probably built the present house about the time of
Henry VIII.&nbsp; In the reign of Elizabeth the Saviles of Howley
possessed it; and in 1600 Sir John Savile, Knight, sold it to
George Bolles, citizen of London, whose descendant, Sir John
Bolles, Baronet, conveyed it to Sir Edmund Turnor, Knight, of
Stoke Rochford.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the above families, I have not
been able to find very much about the Barkworths, who took their
name <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>doubtless from East Barkwith, where
they had property.&nbsp; But Gocelyn de Barkworth, and after him
William de Barkworth, are named in an Assize Roll (4 Ed. II.,
1311) as having possessions in Tetford.&nbsp; In 3 Ed. III.
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1329), William de Barkworth and
his wife &ldquo;fflorianora&rdquo; were plaintiffs in a land
dispute with Robert de Hanay and Alice his wife; whereby &ldquo;1
messuage, 1 carucate of land, 9 acres of meadow, 1 acre of
&lsquo;more,&rsquo; and the moiety of 1 messuage and 1 mill, with
appurtenances in Normanby, Claxby, and Ussylby, were quitclaimed
to William and fflorianora, and fflorianora&rsquo;s
heirs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I may add, as to the item here named &ldquo;1
mill,&rdquo; that a mill in those days was a property of some
value; all the dependents of the lord of the manor were obliged
to have their corn, for man or beast, ground in it; and no other
mill was allowed in the neighbourhood where one was already
established.&nbsp; It is recorded by Beckman that &ldquo;a
certain Abbot wished to erect a mill, which was objected to by a
neighbouring proprietor, who contended that the wind of the whole
district belonged to him.&nbsp; The monks complained to the
bishop, who gave them permission to build, affirming that the
wind of the whole diocese was episcopal property.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rel., Houses,&rdquo; p. 76 note 9.)&nbsp;
In 1351 William de Barkworth, &ldquo;lord of Polume,&rdquo;
presented to the moiety of the chapelry (of Poolham); and in 1369
Thomas de Thymelby presented to it.&nbsp; And from this time the
Thimblebyes take the place of the Barkworths.&nbsp; These
Thimblebyes, whose name is variously spelt Thimelby, Thymbylbye,
and even (as in Domesday Book) Stimblebi, and Stinblebi, were a
numerous and influential race.&nbsp; Their chief residence was
Irnham Park, near Grantham, which was acquired about 1510 by
Richard Thimbleby, on his marriage with the heiress of Godfrey
Hilton, whose ancestor, Sir Geoffrey Hilton, Knight, had obtained
it in 1419, by his marriage with an heiress of the Luterels,
several of whom were called to Parliament, as Barons, in the 13th
century.&nbsp; This was one of fifteen manors given by William
the Conqueror to Ralph Paganel; and with the heiress of his
family it passed, by marriage, to Sir Andrew Luterel,
Knight.&nbsp; The Thymblebyes would seem to have taken their
patronymic from the village of that name (part of which now forms
a portion of the Woodhall Spa parish), as the earlier members of
the family we find designated as Thomas de Thymelby.&nbsp;
Nicholas de Thymelby, and so forth.&nbsp; Besides land in <!--
page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Thimbleby they owned many other estates.&nbsp; For
instance, in the Court of Wards Inquisitions (3, 4, and 5 Edward
VI., vol. v., 91), we find that Matthew Thimbleby &ldquo;of
Polom,&rdquo; who married Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Hussey,
about 1521, died &ldquo;seised of the manors of Polome, Farfford,
Ruckelyond, Somersby, Parish-fee, in Horncastle, Edlynton,
Thymylby, and Tydd St. Mary; also of lands in Horsyngton,
Styxwolde, Blankney, Buckland (<i>i.e.</i> Woodhall), and Flette:
and of the advowsons of Tetforde, Farefford, Rucklonde, and
Somersbye.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Matthew Thimbleby&rsquo;s wealthy
&ldquo;grass widow&rdquo; married again, Sir Robert Savile,
Knight, who (according to Chancery Inquisition, post mortem, 28
Eliz., 1st part, No. 116) &ldquo;died seised of the manors of
Poolham, Horsington, Stixwolde, Edlington, Tetford, Farforth,
Somersby, and Ruckland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before quitting the Thimblebyes, we have one more incident to
name in connection with them.&nbsp; In 1581, one of them,
residing at Poolham, was imprisoned in Lincoln Castle for
refusing to attend the new Reformed Services and Communion.&nbsp;
His wife greatly desired to see him, and was allowed her request
by Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Lincoln.&nbsp; She was near her
confinement, but, as her name was among a list of those not
favourable to the Reformation, she was treated rather roughly,
and detained by force in her husband&rsquo;s cell.&nbsp; This
brought on premature labour, and in the hour of her weakness she
was denied the assistance of a matron.&nbsp; It is said that a
speedy death ended her sufferings; her husband also dying in
prison.&mdash;&ldquo;The Church under Elizabeth,&rdquo; by Dr. F.
G. Lee, vol. ii., p. 60.&nbsp; It is further recorded of this
same Bishop, that he summoned Sir Robert Dymoke to Lincoln for
examination as to his supposed Papist tendencies, and on Sir
Robert excusing himself on the score of ill health, the Bishop
came in person to Scrivelsby and carried him forcibly to Lincoln,
and cast him into prison, where he presently died.&nbsp; It is
not a little curious that one, who, as a doughty knight, at three
coronations threw down his gauntlet and challenged the world on
his Sovereign&rsquo;s behalf, should have succumbed to a
stiff-necked prelate.&nbsp; The account of this is given in
Lodge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scrivelsby, the Home of the
Champions,&rdquo; pp. 77, 78.</p>
<p>We now come to the Saviles.&nbsp; They were a wealthy and
distinguished Yorkshire family, now represented by the Earls of
Mexborough.&nbsp; Sir Robert disposed of some of the property in
<!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>this neighbourhood, which he had acquired by his
marriage with the widow Thimbleby, but he retained Poolham, and
made the Hall his headquarters. <a name="citation142a"></a><a
href="#footnote142a" class="citation">[142a]</a>&nbsp; The
Saviles may have been hot-blooded, for they had not been located
long at Poolham before they became embroiled with their
neighbours.&nbsp; The manners of the times were somewhat rough,
and we here give a sample or two.&nbsp; The autocrat of the
neighbourhood at that time was Henry Fiennes Clinton, second Earl
of Lincoln, who was apparently inclined to ride roughshod over
everyone who came in his way; the object of his life seems to
have been to quarrel, and to keep in a state of irritation the
county from which he derived his title.&nbsp; It is said that
Denzil Hollis, &ldquo;living much at Irby, used to confront the
Earl of Lincoln, who was a great tyrant among the gentry of
Lincolnshire, and to carry business against him, in spite of his
teeth.&rdquo; <a name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"

1590, and, this check withdrawn, the Earl&rsquo;s conduct
increased in violence. <a name="citation142c"></a><a
href="#footnote142c" class="citation">[142c]</a>&nbsp; Lodge, <a
name="citation142d"></a><a href="#footnote142d"
class="citation">[142d]</a> in his records, mentions one Roger
Fullshaw of Waddingworth <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>(near
Horncastle), who, in 1596, prayed for protection against the most
horrible outrages committed by the Earl, and says that his
conduct savoured of insanity.&nbsp; Before he succeeded to the
earldom, and consequently when he had not yet so much power to
oppress, he committed the following aggressions on the Saviles of
Poolham.&nbsp; We must premise that Sir Robert Savile, though a
knight of good estate, and though his descendants became Earls of
Sussex, was, nevertheless, a natural son of Sir Henry Savile, by
Margaret Barkston, &ldquo;his Ladie&rsquo;s gentlewoman,&rdquo;
<a name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a> which, as will be seen, was not
forgotten by the high-born Clinton.&nbsp; These occurrences took
place in 1578.&nbsp; They were neighbours, and jealous of
trespass; and, on the 13th of June, Lord Clinton, &ldquo;with 7
men with cross-bowes and long-bowes bent,&rdquo; forced himself
into the parlour at Poolham Hall, and, after threatening words,
struck Sheffield Savile, the son, on the head.&nbsp; The elder
Savile says that he prevented his son from noticing the outrage,
an unusual degree of forbearance under the circumstances; but
there had evidently been some previous misunderstanding, and
possibly young Savile had been in the wrong.&nbsp; On the 25th of
June following, Lord Clinton, hearing Sir Robert&rsquo;s hounds
hunting in Mr. Welby&rsquo;s wood, <a name="citation143b"></a><a
href="#footnote143b" class="citation">[143b]</a> although it was
no concern of his, seized five of them, and then sent a letter to
Sir Robert, threatening that he would hang them before his house;
and, in fact, did hang them, as Sir Robert says, &ldquo;upon my
own tree within my own ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another violent proceeding is described in a letter of the
Earl&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; Mr. Metham <a
name="citation143c"></a><a href="#footnote143c"
class="citation">[143c]</a> had been previously entertaining Lord
Clinton at Metham, and was now on a return visit to Tattershall;
and, as he relates, &ldquo;It pleased him (Lord Clinton) to
carrye me with my companye through his park (still surviving in
the name &ldquo;Tattershall park&rdquo;) unto the chase, where
his meaning was to have made sport with hounds <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>and
greyhounds (i.e., badger hounds), and leading me by, into the
meadows, he shewed me certain of the great deer of the chase,
such as he kept rather for show than to be hunted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These would be the red deer (cervus elaphus) still existing then
on Hatfield chase, in the northwest of the county, in
considerable numbers.&nbsp; The deer broke away into Mr.
Welby&rsquo;s woods, and &ldquo;thence, as my lord affirmed, with
an oath, into the mouths of the Saviles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord
Clinton&rsquo;s attendants followed the hounds, Lord Clinton
himself not doing so; but, in passing along a lane, he
encountered some of the Savile followers, &ldquo;in number 20 or
24, the more part having swords, bucklers, and daggers, some
pyked staves, one a cross-bowe with an arrowe, another a long
bowe and arrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; While words were being exchanged
&ldquo;ould Mr. Savile&rdquo; came up, and the following
characteristic dialogue ensued.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord Clinton, yf
thou be a man, light, and fight with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With
thee, bastardlye knave,&rdquo; quoth my lord, &ldquo;I will deal
with thee well enough, and teach thee, knave, thy
duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which words Mr. Savile called my lord
&ldquo;a cowardly knave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Challenges passed between
them, and with Sheffield Savile, who, withdrawing, as he says,
Lord Clinton by the arm, called out after him, &ldquo;You a lord,
you are a kitchen boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Robert, after their
departure, having got hold of one of Lord Clinton&rsquo;s dogs,
meant, Metham says, &ldquo;to use it with like courtesy as my
lord has done his.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Clinton then approached
Poolham Hall, and a challenge passed, through John Savile, to
fight six to six, &ldquo;which by good entreaty was
stayed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Savile says, <a name="citation144"></a><a
href="#footnote144" class="citation">[144]</a> in his narrative,
that the followers of Lord Clinton were entertained at
Horncastle, the same day, with a buck; and getting hold of an
unfortunate tailor, some ten or twelve of them drew their swords
and sore wounded him, saying he should &ldquo;have that, and
more, for his master&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Sheffield
Savile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lansdown MSS. give details of other violent proceedings of
Lord Clinton towards the Saviles; how he over-ran the lands of
Poolham with 60 men, armed with guns, cross-bows, and long bows;
how he ill-treated their servants sent to Tattershall on domestic
errands; incited the neighbours to send challenges to them; how
he tried to entice into his park the younger Saviles, and laid
ambushes for them; and various other proceedings which he would
not for a moment <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>have tolerated in anyone else.&nbsp;
It redounds, indeed, to the credit of the Saviles that Poolham
was not made the scene of retaliation and bloodshed. <a
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a></p>
<p>In 1600 Sir John Savile sold Poolham to George Bolles,
Esq.&nbsp; Of the Bolles family I have been able to find but
scanty mention.&nbsp; Among Lincolnshire Gentry who supplied
demy-lances and light horse, at the Louth Sessions, March,
1586&ndash;7, Charles Bolles is named as &ldquo;Captaine,&rdquo;
furnishing &ldquo;ij. horse&rdquo;; and Richard Bolles &ldquo;ij
launces&rdquo; and &ldquo;ij horse&rdquo;; while Richard Bowles,
which is probably the same name, is mentioned along with Sir
Willm. Skipwith, Mr. Willm. Fitzwilliam, and Mr. Andrewe Gedney,
Sir William&rsquo;s son-in-law, as the officials who presided at
the &ldquo;Spittle Sessions,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, at Spittal in
the Street, near Kirton in Lindsey.</p>
<p>The last of this family to occupy Poolham was Sir John Bolles,
Bart., who conveyed it to Sir Edmund Turnor of Stoke
Rochford.&nbsp; Sir John Bolles is connected with the pretty and
interesting legend and ballad of &ldquo;The Green Lady of Thorpe
Hall,&rdquo; which was his chief residence.&nbsp; The ballad is
among Percy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reliques,&rdquo; and records how,
while serving in Spain, the knight made captive a noble Spanish
lady, who fell in love with her captor; but he had to check and
chill her advances, in this language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Courteous ladye, leave this fancy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes all that breeds the strife;<br />
I in England have already<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sweet woman to my wife.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which, after craving pardon for her offence, she
replies,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Commend me to thy lovely
lady,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear to her this chain of gold;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And these bracelets for a token:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grieving that I was so bold.<br />
All my jewels, in like sort, take thou with thee,<br />
They are fitting for thy wife but not for me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tradition, confirmed in recent years in correspondence by
connections of the family (see notes to ballad, &ldquo;The
Spanish Lady&rsquo;s Love,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 144, ed. 1848)
affirms that, on Sir John leaving Spain for home, the lady
&ldquo;sent as presents to his wife, a profusion of jewellery and
other valuables,&rdquo; with a portrait of herself dressed in
green.&nbsp; Hence she was named &ldquo;the Green
Lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was said that she haunted Thorpe Hall, that
her apparition was occasionally seen, and that it was long the
custom <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>to have a plate laid for her at this
table at mealtime.&nbsp; That this story does not belong entirely
to the region of fiction is proved by the fact, known to the
writer, and, doubtless, to many others, that a lady in this
neighbourhood possesses, and at times wears on her person, one
article from the &ldquo;Green Lady&rsquo;s&rdquo; gift of
jewellery.</p>
<p>We have one more moated mansion in our neighbourhood which
should here be mentioned, viz., Halstead, or Hawstead, Hall, in
the adjoining parish of Stixwould.&nbsp; This is the one
instance, out of the several old residences I have mentioned, in
which there still remains a substantial building
above-ground.&nbsp; Doubtless the Hall, originally, was
considerably larger than it is at present, since, at different
periods, it has been occupied by members of leading county
families; and I find, from a note, that the first Earl of
Shaftesbury, who married a sister of Lord Coventry, at one time
owner of Stixwould, used to visit here, and accommodation was
found for himself and a large retinue.&nbsp; Foundations of
further buildings have been found at odd times.&nbsp; The present
Hall is a two-storied structure; the rooms not large, but lofty,
their height on the ground floor being over 10ft., and on the
upper floor more than 13ft.; with spacious attics above for
stores.&nbsp; The walls are very substantial, being 2&frac12;ft.
thick; while the windows, with their massive Ancaster mullions,
would further indicate a much larger building.&nbsp; Outside the
now dry bed of the moat stands a lofty building, at present used
as stables and barn, which has stoneframed windows, the walls
being of brick, smaller than the present-day bricks, and
resembling those of Tattershall Castle and the Tower on the Moor,
and, doubtless, made close at hand, where there is still a
brickyard.&nbsp; The walls are relieved by diamond-shaped
patterns, of black brick, those in the upper part being smaller
than those below. <a name="citation146"></a><a
href="#footnote146" class="citation">[146]</a>&nbsp; A very fine
mantelpiece, formerly in Halstead Hall, is now at Denton House,
near Grantham, the seat of Sir William Earle Welby Gregory,
Bart., <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>who is the present head of the
family.&nbsp; It is after the fashion of the famous mantelpieces
of Tattershall Castle.&nbsp; In recent times Halstead Hall has
been chiefly known for the great robbery which occurred there on
Feb. 2nd, 1829, and which has been related in Chapter II. of this
volume.&nbsp; But, though no connected account of its early
owners or occupants can be given, some interesting details have
been brought together by the Rev. J. A. Penny, Vicar of
Wispington, and formerly of Stixwould, which are given, with a
sketch of the Hall, in &ldquo;Lincolnshire Notes &amp;
Queries&rdquo; (vol. iii., pp. 33&ndash;37).&nbsp; The estate was
the property of Richard Welby of Moulton, being named in his
will, 1465.&nbsp; He left it to a son &ldquo;Morys,&rdquo; from
whom it passed to a brother Roger, and from one of his sons came
the Welbys of Halstead.&nbsp; The will of one of them is
preserved among the &ldquo;Lincoln Wills (1st series) proved 18
August, 1524,&rdquo; wherein he desired &ldquo;to be buried in
the Church of Stixwolde before the image of our Lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1561, March 21, the representative of the Halstead branch
of this one of our leading county families was granted the crest
of &ldquo;an armed arm, the hand charnell (<i>i.e.</i>,
flesh-coloured) yssvinge out of a cloud, azure, in a flame of
fire&rdquo;; and the arms are sable, a fess, between three
fleur-de-lis, argent, with six quarterings.&nbsp; He, Richard
Welby, was in that year Sheriff for the county.</p>
<p>In 1588, Vincent Welby is named in the list of gentry who
subscribed &pound;25 each to the loan for repelling the expected
Spanish Armada, and at the muster at Horncastle, in 1586&ndash;7,
he furnished &ldquo;ij horse,&rdquo; as also did his relative Mr.
Welby of Gouphill (Goxhill) at &ldquo;Castor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
first entry of the Welbys in the Stixwould Registers was
&ldquo;Ann Welbie, christened May 28,&rdquo; 1547; the last was
in 1598.&nbsp; After them Halstead Hall was owned by a family of
the name of Evington, one of whom, Richard, left &ldquo;iiijli xs
to be paid yearlie, at the discretion of my executors, to the
poor of Stixwolde, on the 25 March and 29 Sept.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After them it was occupied by the Townshends.&nbsp; Of this
family there are two notices in the parish
register:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Townshend Esqr died att
Halstead and was buryed att Waddingworth on Wensdaie night the
13th of Februarie 1627.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other is, &ldquo;Mr.
Kirkland Snawden and Mrs. Francis Townshend married the 25th of
December, being Christmas daie 1628.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notice the
Lincolnshire pronunciation Snawden for Snowden.&nbsp; No reason
is given for the unusual burial by night; and special <!-- page
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>attention is drawn to the marriage of the widow, by the
sketch in the margin of a hand with outstretched fingers.&nbsp;
This Kirkland Snowden was a grandson of a Bishop of Carlisle, his
father being the Bishop&rsquo;s son, and Vicar of
Horncastle.&nbsp; They had a daughter Abigail, who married a
Dymoke, from whom the present Dymokes are descended.&nbsp; This
is one of two instances of a daughter of a Vicar of Horncastle
marrying a Dymoke, since in the present century Miss Madeley, the
only daughter of Dr. Clement Madeley, Vicar, married the late
champion, Rev. John Dymoke.&nbsp; After these it was held by the
Gibbons, of which family there are also a few entries in the
registers.&nbsp; Another owner was Sir John Coventry, who was
assaulted for using offensive language about King Charles II.,
asking in Parliament &ldquo;whether the king&rsquo;s pleasure lay
in the men or women players&rdquo; at the theatres.&nbsp; He
wounded several of his assailants, but had his own nose cut to
the bone; in consequence of which &ldquo;The Coventry Act&rdquo;
was passed in 1671, making it felony to maim or disfigure a
person, and refusing to allow the king to pardon the
offenders.&nbsp; A later owner was Sir William Kite, Bart., who
ran through a large fortune, and sold Halstead and Stixwould to
Lord Anson, the distinguished navigator, and Lord High Admiral of
England; some of whose exploits are recorded in
&ldquo;Anson&rsquo;s Voyage Round the World,&rdquo; by Benjamin
Robins.&nbsp; In 1778 the property was sold to Edmund Turnor,
Esq., and is still held by his descendants.&nbsp; This old house
is well worth a visit; and visitors are courteously received by
the family who now reside there.</p>
<p>I now propose to invite the visitor to Woodhall Spa to
accompany me in thought (as not a few have done in person) to
some of the places of interest, churches, or ruins, in the
neighbourhood, as it may add a zest to his perambulations to know
something about them.&nbsp; The descriptions will probably be
brief, leaving a margin to be filled in by his own personal
observation, thus affording him a motive for further enquiry, and
an aim and object for the rambles, which may conduce to his
health in the expansion alike of mind and of lung.&nbsp; Woodhall
does not lie within what may be called the architectural zone of
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; In the south, south-east, and south-west of
the county, parish after parish possesses a large church, often
beyond the requirements of the population, and of great and
varied architectural beauty.&nbsp; There is probably no district
in England so rich in fine <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>edifices.&nbsp; Much of the land was at one time held
by powerful Norman knights and barons, whose energies were often
spent in internecine feuds.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val creed
impressed them with the belief that their deeds of violence could
be atoned for by the erection of costly churches for the worship,
by others, of that God whom they themselves little
honoured.&nbsp; Interested ecclesiastics fostered this feeling,
<a name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a"
class="citation">[149a]</a> which also fell in with the
&ldquo;Ora pro nobis&rdquo; yearning of their own breasts, when
suffering from what an old writer has called &ldquo;the ayen-bite
of Inwyt,&rdquo; <a name="citation149b"></a><a
href="#footnote149b" class="citation">[149b]</a> or, in modern
parlance, &ldquo;remorse of conscience.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if,
judged by the scale of expiation, made in endowment and embodied
in stone, these high-handed lords would seem to have been sinners
above their more ordinary fellows, we must at least gratefully
allow that they have left to us of the present day a goodly
heritage, which even our modern vastly increased wealth has not
enabled us to emulate.&nbsp; These fine churches, in <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>our neighbourhood may be said to terminate at Coningsby
and Tattershall.</p>
<p>In the villages immediately near us, and for several miles
northward and eastward, the churches are small; yet several of
them have features of considerable interest.&nbsp; Let us turn
our steps northward.&nbsp; The road takes us in sight of a
column, or obelisk, surmounted by a bust of the first Duke of
Wellington.&nbsp; The history of this is told by the inscription
on the pedestal: &ldquo;Waterloo Wood was raised from acorns sown
immediately after the memorable battle of Waterloo, when victory
was achieved by the great Captain of the age, his Grace the Duke
of Wellington, commanding the British forces, against the French
armies commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, the 18th June, 1815,
which momentous victory gave general peace to Europe.&nbsp; This
monument was erected by R. E. (Richard Elmhirst)
1844.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bust faces to the north-east, in the
direction of West Ashby, where Colonel Elmhirst resided.&nbsp;
The property some years ago passed, by sale, into other
hands.&nbsp; At about three miles distance from Woodhall we reach
the small but well-built village of Stixwould (in Domesday Book,
Stigesuuald, Stigeswalt, Stigeswalde).&nbsp; As to the name
Stixwould, anyone, without being a wag, might well say, and with
some apparent reason, &ldquo;What more natural combination than
these two syllables?&rdquo;&nbsp; We naturally, in primitive
life, go to the &ldquo;wald,&rdquo; or wood, for our
sticks.&nbsp; Was not the liberty to gather
&ldquo;kindling,&rdquo; as we now call it, a valued privilege,
even like the parallel right of &ldquo;turbage&rdquo;&mdash;to
cut peat&mdash;for the domestic hearth?&nbsp; The
&ldquo;sticks-wood&rdquo; would be the resort of many a serf and
villain, for purposes lawful, or the reverse.&nbsp; But,
unfortunately, the most apparently obvious explanation is not
necessarily the correct one.&nbsp; Whether the first part of this
name has a reference to a staked-out ford on the Witham,
corresponding to the &ldquo;wath,&rdquo; or ford, at Kirkstead,
or whether it is from the old Norse &ldquo;stigt,&rdquo; a path,
as some suggest, is uncertain.&nbsp; Streatfeild says, &ldquo;The
swampy locality would favour the idea of
&lsquo;stakes&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lincolnshire and the
Danes,&rdquo; pp. 147&ndash;8).&nbsp; I may here notice that the
old name of Dublin (Dubh-lynn, <i>i.e.</i> the black water) was
Athcleath, or &ldquo;the ford of the hurdles,&rdquo; which seems
a parallel instance (&ldquo;The Vikings of Western
Christendom,&rdquo; by C. F. Keary, p. 83, n. 3).&nbsp; The
latter half of the name would seem to refer to the woods of the
district; and <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>visitors may see a very fine
specimen of an ancient oak in the garden of the Abbey Farm at the
farther end of the village; also a fine one at Halstead Hall, to
the east of the village; and there are several more in the
fields, relics, doubtless, of ancient woods.&nbsp; The church was
rebuilt in 1831, not a favourable period in church restoration,
but on the whole Mr. Padley, the architect, did his work fairly
well, although some spoliation was perpetrated, stained glass
being taken away from the windows; and the panels of the pulpit
in Lea church are said to have been also taken from here.&nbsp;
Some notes, still preserved in vol. ii. (p. 87) of
Willson&rsquo;s Collection (architect and surveyor, of Lincoln)
would seem to imply that the former church was finer than the
present.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;Stixwould church, spacious, and
has been elegant, and is full of curious remnants; style Ed. IV.
or Henry VII.; tower very handsome; . . .&nbsp; The interior has
been very beautiful&mdash;lofty pointed arches, roof of nave and
south aisle supported on rich carved figures of angels with
shields; windows full of remnants of beautiful glass; old oak
desks and benches carved . . . curious font . . . upper end of
south aisle inclosed in two screens of oak . . . exquisitely rich
and elegant.&nbsp; This is called the little choir, and belongs
to Halstead Hall . . . both aisles have had altars.&nbsp; Base
and pillar of churchyard cross remain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also
mentions a curiously-carved stone in the churchyard in front of
the tower, &ldquo;like a clock face,&rdquo; with unusual
inscription; which the present writer has also seen there; but it
is now removed to Lincoln. <a name="citation151a"></a><a
href="#footnote151a" class="citation">[151a]</a></p>
<p>The Rev. J. A. Penny, formerly Vicar of Stixwould, furnished
the following description of the present church, when the writer,
as local honorary secretary, conducted the &ldquo;Lincoln and
Notts. Architectural Society&rdquo; round the neighbourhood in
1894:&mdash;&ldquo;The figures and pinnacles on the tower are
from the old tower; the choir screen was formed from that
formerly round the small choir, but only one-third of the
original, <a name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a> which was used as a pew by the <!--
page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>tenants of Halstead Hall.&nbsp; Under the stone slab
nearest the screen, in the nave, were deposited the remains of a
Mr. Boulton, who stabbed his mother to death in the little chapel
outside the Priory gate, for which he was hanged at
Lincoln.&nbsp; The stone face and wooden angels are from the
former church, as also the bench ends on the south side.&nbsp;
The royal arms, with date 1662, are in a wall in the Abbey
farmhouse; and the holy water stoup is under the pump in the
school yard.&nbsp; The fine slab, with cross, now under the
tower, was dug up on the site of the Priory, also the stone
coffin which stands there; and the rest in the vicarage
garden.&nbsp; One of the bells is exactly the same as that in the
Guildhall at Lincoln, and dates from 1370; it is dedicated to St.
Katine, with foundry mark (Nottingham), founder&rsquo;s initials,
and merchant&rsquo;s mark.&nbsp; The font is octagonal, with
evangelic emblems, and names, on four sides; on the other sides,
a monk seated in a chair and holding Y in his arms; next a man
with arms akimbo, facing due east; next a monk, or Friar; and
next a figure in flab cap, with sword, holding a rose in his left
hand, his right resting on his belt.&nbsp; These four figures
come between the emblems of St. Mark and St. Luke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Religious House, or Priory, at Stixwould, the published
accounts are not quite in accord.&nbsp; Stukeley and Dugdale <a
name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a"
class="citation">[152a]</a> place it among the Benedictine
establishments, whereas Leland calls it Cistercian; <a
name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b"
class="citation">[152b]</a> this, however, is hardly a
contradiction, since the Cistercians were &ldquo;the straitest
sect&rdquo; of the Benedictines. <a name="citation152c"></a><a
href="#footnote152c" class="citation">[152c]</a>&nbsp; It is said
generally to have been founded by the Lady Lucia
(&ldquo;Comitissa Cestri&aelig; et Lincoln&rdquo;), widow of the
great Norman Baron, Ivo Taillebois, who came over with the
Conqueror and to have been further endowed by her two sons,
Ranulph, Earl of Chester, and William de Romara, Earl of Lincoln.
<a name="citation152d"></a><a href="#footnote152d"
class="citation">[152d]</a>&nbsp; We may just observe here, in
passing, that the figure cut into the stone which supports the
credence table, in the chancel of <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Woodhall, is supposed to be that of this
Countess Lucia, being brought from the ruins of Stixwould
Priory.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Cox, in his
&ldquo;Lincolnshire&rdquo; (1719), however, says that the founder
was Galfred de Ezmondeys.&nbsp; Doubtless, various persons, and
at different periods, endowed or enlarged the foundation, and so
became entitled to be counted among the
&ldquo;fundatores.&rdquo;&nbsp; By an Inquisition, taken at
Stamford, 3 Ed. I., it was found that &ldquo;the Master and
Nuns&rdquo; held divers lands at Huntington, of the gift of
several benefactors, among them being Alexander Creviquer, Lucia,
Countess of Chester, and her son Ranulph; and that &ldquo;they
had been so held for the space of one hundred years.&rdquo; <a
name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a"
class="citation">[153a]</a>&nbsp; Ultimately it became a very
wealthy institution, having, besides property in Lincoln, lands
lying in 13 Deaneries, and in the Soke of Grantham in more than a
dozen parishes; with the advowson of the Benefices of Stixwould
and Wainfleet, a pension from Alford, and other property, one
item being &ldquo;two tofts in Horsington to provide lamps and
tapers for the service of the altar.&rdquo; <a
name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a>&nbsp; The rules of this establishment
were very strict.&nbsp; The lives of the nuns were to be devoted
to prayer and works of charity.&nbsp; Their leisure hours were
occupied in reading, or relating legends of Saints, in working
tapestry, embroidering altar and pulpit cloths, and such like. <a
name="citation153c"></a><a href="#footnote153c"
class="citation">[153c]</a>&nbsp; The convent was so entirely
shut in by walls, according to the old regulation, &ldquo;as
scarcely to leave an entrance for birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
not allowed even to converse with each other without license from
the Prioress.&nbsp; If strangers wished to communicate with them,
it was only allowed through a grating, veiled, and in the
presence of witnesses.&nbsp; They confessed periodically to the
Incumbent of the parish, with a latticed window between
them.&nbsp; By one of their rules they were not to go alone even
into the garden, except under great necessity, and on festivals;
and no flowers, except jessamine and violets, were to be plucked,
without permission from the sacrist; and they could only leave
the convent on account of illness, to console the sick, or attend
funerals, except by episcopal dispensation.&nbsp; <!-- page
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Nevertheless, although nominally living thus under
severe restraint, it would appear that certain relaxations were
allowed.&nbsp; They were at times permitted to exercise the
accomplishments of music, and even dancing.&nbsp; They had their
processions and other monastic amusements, like the monks, and
even patronized the feast of fools, and other absurdities of the
times. <a name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a"
class="citation">[154a]</a>&nbsp; We may even picture to
ourselves the Prioress indulging in the sport of hunting, for she
had charters of free warren over the Priory lands, <a
name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b"
class="citation">[154b]</a> and the Harleyan MSS., in the British
Museum, have illuminated representations of buxom dames, riding
with hounds, and shooting stags, and bears, with cross-bow;
wearing sensible clothing and seated astride on their palfreys <a
name="citation154c"></a><a href="#footnote154c"
class="citation">[154c]</a>.&nbsp; The State Records speak of
these devotional ladies as &ldquo;the holy Nuns of
Stixwold,&rdquo; <a name="citation154d"></a><a
href="#footnote154d" class="citation">[154d]</a> yet, at one
time, public complaint was made that the Prioress of Stixwould
had no scruples in so encroaching upon the waters of the Witham
and diverting its course, that the vessels accustomed to ply on
it with turf and faggots for the people of Lincoln, could now
only do so at great peril. <a name="citation154e"></a><a
href="#footnote154e" class="citation">[154e]</a>&nbsp; We may,
perhaps, however, exonerate the &ldquo;Lady Superior&rdquo; and
her nuns from all blame in this matter, when we remember that
there was a &ldquo;Master of the Nuns&rdquo; <a
name="citation154f"></a><a href="#footnote154f"
class="citation">[154f]</a> and other male officials who, indeed,
battened on the Priory in such numbers, that it was even said
that they were more numerous than the sisters. <a
name="citation154g"></a><a href="#footnote154g"
class="citation">[154g]</a></p>
<p>I have dwelt thus at some length on these details, because
Stixwould is the next parish to Woodhall, and within easy access
of the visitor to the Spa; further, this Priory, like that of
Sempringham in the south of the county, occupies a peculiar
position, being one of a limited number of such establishments,
which harboured the two sexes, canons as well as nuns, within
their walls; an arrangement of questionable wisdom and propriety.
<a name="citation154h"></a><a href="#footnote154h"
class="citation">[154h]</a>&nbsp; We have only <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>to add that
this Priory was suppressed by Henry VIII., with other lesser
monasteries, in the 28th year of his reign; but in the following
year, out of the sincere devotion that he had to the Virgin Mary,
and for the increase of virtue, and the divine worship, &ldquo;he
reconstituted it, as a Pre-monstratensian Monastery, to consist
of a Prioress and Nuns, to officiate . . . for the good estate of
him and of his most dear consort, Jane, Queen of England, while
they lived, and after their deaths for their souls, and the souls
of their children and progenitors,&rdquo; and he re-endowed it
with all the possessions which it had previously held. <a
name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, as Henry&rsquo;s
love for his consorts was not remarkable for its stability,
neither was the singular favour which he thus showed to the
Priory, for, two years afterwards, he again, and finally,
dissolved it, and granted it to John Dighton.&nbsp; Sic
transit!</p>
<p>Other objects of interest have been found in Stixwould.&nbsp;
My friend, the late Vicar, <a name="citation155b"></a><a
href="#footnote155b" class="citation">[155b]</a> writes &ldquo;I
found two glass &lsquo;bottle stamps,&rsquo; 1&#8540; ins. in
diameter; one of these has the figure of a dog, and
&lsquo;Rowles,&rsquo; in printed letters, beneath it; the other
has &lsquo;Anth. Boulton, Stixwo. 1722.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Boultons
lived at the &lsquo;Abbey farm&rsquo; for several generations,
until the one (already mentioned) who committed murder.&nbsp; The
bottles were made more like ship decanters, or the flagons of
Australian wines, than our ordinary bottles.&nbsp; I also found
many small pieces of medi&aelig;val pottery, some pieces of
&lsquo;puzzle jugs,&rsquo; with holes, and the neck of a
&lsquo;pilgrim&rsquo;s bottle,&rsquo; of Cistercian ware, so
called, as I was told by the late Sir Augustus Franks, of the
British Museum, because it has only been found on the sites of
Cistercian houses.&nbsp; The colour of medi&aelig;val pottery is
as superior to the modern as ancient glass is to that of the
present day, and it is sometimes tastefully ornamented with
finger marks.&nbsp; The stone coffins, by the tower of Stixwould
Church, were dug up where the Abbey Church formerly stood, in the
field at the back of the present Abbey farm orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>There are several large blocks of stone, at different
farmyards, which came from the Abbey.&nbsp; The stocks, until a
few years ago, stood in the centre of the junction of the
Horsington and Woodhall Spa roads, at the east end of the village
street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Horsington</span>.&mdash;About two miles
from Stixwould, north-eastward, is Horsington, its name,
probably, being compounded of the Saxon elements horse-ing-ton
<i>i.e.</i>, the village with horse-meadows; that the central
syllable is not the patronymic &ldquo;ing&rdquo; is evident,
since about a mile away we have, also, Poolham
&ldquo;Ings,&rdquo; which are rich meadow lands on that, the
adjoining, manor.&nbsp; The present church of Horsington is
modern, having been built in 1860, of brick, with stone
dressings, in place of a previous very poor thatched structure,
into which one entered by a descent of two steps, with something
of the feeling of descending into a dripping well.&nbsp; The
present edifice is neat, but of no great architectural merit, and
is already, in parts, becoming dilapidated, the stonework of the
spire being much weatherworn.&nbsp; It is not, however, strictly
speaking, the parish church, but rather a chapel of ease.&nbsp;
The ancient church was &ldquo;All Hallows,&rdquo; the site of
which is shewn by a mound in the fields to the south-west of the
present village, at a point which is almost equi-distant from
Stixwould in the south, Bucknall to the west, and Horsington
village itself; and is said, traditionally, to have been the
common church of all three parishes before their present churches
were built.&nbsp; Separated from it now by a small drain is the
old burial ground.&nbsp; Tradition connects this site with the
Fire-ceremony of November, in British times, once prevalent in
Asia, as well as Europe, and even in America.&nbsp; The beginning
of the year was then fixed by the culminating of the
constellation Pleiades, in November.&nbsp; On the first of the
month bonfires were lighted, as they have been by the Welsh in
quite recent times, and, along with the fire, the emblem of
purity, offerings were made on behalf of the dead, the sacrifices
of animals being so numerous on this and other days, that the
month acquired the name of Blot-monath, <i>i.e.</i>,
Blood-month.&nbsp; The Venerable Bede, <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> tells us that, at the request of Pope
Boniface, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 611, the Emperor Phocas
ordered, according to a general practice, that, on the site, in
Rome, where &ldquo;all the gods&rdquo; had been worshipped, which
was called the <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Pantheon, the filth of idolatry
being abolished, a church should be erected in memory of the
Blessed Virgin and all Martyrs; and on this principle, in other
places also, the site of the heathen worship, and the day of its
special observance, were transformed into the occasion and place
of observance of the Christian festival of &ldquo;All
Hallows,&rdquo; or &ldquo;All Saints&rdquo; day; and in the
course of re-corrupting time the offering on behalf of the dead
by the heathen, and the commemorative ceremony of the early
Christian, passed into &ldquo;prayers for the dead,&rdquo; which
became general in a later age.&nbsp; Further, to give their
sympathies a wider compass, the old &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo;
tells us that &ldquo;Saynt Odylle ordeyned that the feast and
remembraunce of all them that ben departed (generally) out of
this worlde sholde be holden in al monasteryes, the daye after
the fest Halowen (All Hallows even); the wyche thynge was
approved after all holye Chyrche.&rdquo; <a
name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a>&nbsp; This is the old Christian
black-letter festival of &ldquo;All Souls,&rdquo; generally, as
distinguished from the red-letter, &ldquo;All Saints
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are some of the old traditions which hang,
like evergreen garlands, round our sacred places.&nbsp; Children
may once have &ldquo;passed through fire to Molech&rdquo; where
now the heaving turf shrouds the skeleton of a decayed
church.</p>
<p>On the walls of the church are tablets with the following
inscriptions:&mdash;&ldquo;To the beloved memory of Frederick
Evan Cowper Smith, Lieutenant, Royal Artillery, eldest son of the
late T. F. Smith formerly Rector of this Parish.&nbsp; He died of
Fever, brought on by over-exertion in the discharge of his duty,
while on active service in Afghanistan, with the Kyber Line Field
Force, on July 26th, 1880, when he had just completed 19 years of
earthly life.&nbsp; Jesu Mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; A second is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of Arthur Monro Cowper
Smith, Captain in the Royal Field Artillery, and graduate of
Trinity College, Cambridge; he died at Beira, East Africa, on
Sept. 28, 1898, in the 36th year of his age, of injuries received
in a grass fire while shooting big game on the Pungwe
River.&nbsp; He was the second son of the Rev. T. F. Smith, B.D.,
late Rector of this Parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another tablet is in memory of the Rev. T. F. Smith, B.C.,
&ldquo;formerly Fellow of St. Mary Magdalen College, Oxford, and
Rector of this parish, who died May 21, 1871, aged 50.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fourth is to the memory of Colonel Bonar <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Millett
Deane, second son of Rev. G. Deane, late Rector of Bighton.&nbsp;
He died in South Africa, gallantly leading a column of the 58th
Regiment, under General Colley, at the battle of Laing&rsquo;s
Nek, January 28, 1881, aged 46 years.&nbsp; &ldquo;He fought a
good fight, he kept the faith.&nbsp; Jesu Mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was a relative of the late Rector, the Rev. F. H. Deane, B.D.,
afterwards Rector of South Kilworth, Rugby.</p>
<p>A document in the parish chest shews that the burial ground
was, at one time, <i>re-purchased</i> for a burial, and fenced
in, while other papers shew how this came about, viz., that the
duty of the parishioners to keep up the churchyard fence had been
neglected (as has also occurred in other places in this
neighbourhood), and so the land lapsed, and had to be
recovered.&nbsp; In these papers, both church and chapel are
named as distinct, which again is confirmed by the Will <a
name="citation158"></a><a href="#footnote158"
class="citation">[158]</a> of John Kele, parson of Horsington, 26
January, 1540, in which he directs that his body shall be
&ldquo;buryed in the Quire of All Hallows,&rdquo; and bequeaths
to &ldquo;the church of Horsington on mass boke (one mass book),
on port huse (Breviary), on boke called Manipulus
Curatorum&rdquo;; he adds, &ldquo;I also wyll that on broken
chalyce, that I have, be sold, and <i>wared</i> off the chancell
of the chapell of Horsington; proved 17 Feb. 1540.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he is to be buried at All Hallows, and makes a bequest to
the &ldquo;Horsington Church,&rdquo; this evidently again being
All Hallows; but the money produced by the sale of the broken
chalice is to be <i>wared</i> (note the Lincolnshire word,
<i>i.e.</i>, spent) on &ldquo;the chancell of the
chapell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pilgrim from Woodhall Spa can find his
way by a pleasant walk of 2&frac12; miles, mostly through the
fields, northwards from the Bath-house, or along the
Stixwould-road, re-entering the fields a little westward of
&ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s Row,&rdquo; and so by Halstead Hall, and to
All Hallows.&nbsp; We now proceed to later incidents in
Horsington history.&nbsp; There are the traces of two old moated
mansions, one on the right of the road going from Woodhall Spa,
about a quarter of a mile before reaching the village: there is
now a small farmhouse within the moat, which is shaded by its
sallows or willow trees.&nbsp; Nearly opposite, a cross cut in
the turf by the road shews where a man was killed some years
ago.&nbsp; The other traces are to be seen in the field just to
the south of the present churchyard.&nbsp; The field is still
called &ldquo;Hall close,&rdquo; and the moats, ponds, and <!--
page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>mounds cover some two acres.&nbsp; It has been the
residence of a family of importance; and we find among the list
of those gentry who contributed their &pound;25 to the Armada
Fund the name of Robert Smythe, --- of Horsington.&nbsp; In the
register of burials is the entry, dated 1671, &ldquo;Bridget Hall
wiff of Robert Hall buried in her own yard Dec. 1st,
1671.&rdquo;&nbsp; She lived at &ldquo;Hall farm,&rdquo; near the
road from Horsington to Bucknall; and deeming it popish to lie
east and west in a churchyard, she directed that her body should
be buried north and south in her own garden.&nbsp; Some years ago
the occupier, in digging a drain between the house and the road,
came upon a skeleton lying north and south, presumably that of
Bridget Hall.</p>
<p>Here is another odd circumstance.&nbsp; We now have our
splendid county asylums for our lunatics, but the writer can
remember the case of an unfortunate lunatic who was kept chained
to the kitchen fire-place in a house in Horncastle, was never
unchained, and slept on the brick floor.&nbsp; At Horsington the
parish officers made special provision for the insane.&nbsp; In
the parish chest there was, until quite recently, <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a> a brass collar, to which was attached
a chain for securing the unfortunate individual by the
neck.&nbsp; The writer was lately informed by an old Horsington
man, over 80 years of age, that the last occasion on which this
collar was used was early in the 19th century.&nbsp; A villager
then residing near the present blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, and named
Joe Kent, had two insane daughters, who had a very strong
antipathy to each other, so that they had always to be kept
apart, or they would have killed each other.&nbsp; My informant
took me to what formerly was the garden of Kent&rsquo;s house,
and pointed out two spots where these two unfortunate creatures
were, in fine weather, chained to the wall, one by the neck and
the other by the waist, about 15 yards apart.&nbsp; When within
doors they were similarly secured in separate rooms, treatment,
surely, which was calculated to aggravate rather than alleviate
their afflictions, but those were days in which rough remedies
were too often resorted to.</p>
<p>Horsington was further connected with an incident which, had
it not been nipped in the bud, might have had most serious
national consequences, viz., what is known as &ldquo;the Cato
street conspiracy,&rdquo; the leader of which was Arthur
Thistlewood, a native of Horsington.&nbsp; <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>His proper
name was Burnett, the name of his mother, he not being born in
wedlock.&nbsp; She was the daughter of a small shopkeeper in the
village.&nbsp; Thistlewood, his father, was a farmer, and Burnett
was brought up with the rest of Thistlewood&rsquo;s family.&nbsp;
Possibly his peculiar position may have soured his temper.&nbsp;
The following extracts taken from a recent publication give
contemporary information as to the details of this dangerous and
daringly-conceived plot. <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a>&nbsp; The Earl of
Hardwick, writing to Lady Elizabeth Stuart, then in Paris, Feb.
24, 1820, states that he had, in London, just received
information of a plot to assassinate ministers as they came from
dinner at Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; (The Duke of Berry had
been assassinated in Paris, at the door of the Opera House, on
Feb. 13th, 1820, only eleven days before.)&nbsp; Thirty men, his
lordship says, were found in a hay-loft, all armed.&nbsp; Notice
had been privately given to the police of the plot, and the
dinner had been consequently postponed.&nbsp; These men had
probably met to consider the cause of this postponement.&nbsp;
Nine of the party were taken, the rest escaping by a rope
ladder.&nbsp; Lord Hardwick, writing again at 4 p.m. the same
day, says, &ldquo;I have just seen the leaders of the horrible
plot . . .&nbsp; Thistlewood was taken to the Treasury, where he
was about to be examined.&nbsp; Townshend the police officer
asked if I would like to see him . . . he was sitting over the
fire without his hat; it was easy to distinguish him from the
rest, by the character of ferocity which marked his countenance,
which had a singularly bad expression . . . Sir Charles Flint
took me to another room, where there were several of the arms
taken; 7 pistols and bayonets, 4 daggers, or pike heads, two feet
in length; and some muskets.&nbsp; A sergeant of the guard was
wounded in the arm by a ball which had passed through his hand;
he also received three balls in the crown of his
hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thistlewood was taken in White Cross Street,
near Finsbury Square, in his bed.&nbsp; The place where the
conspirators were discovered by the police was the loft of a
stable at the &ldquo;Horse and Groom&rdquo; public-house, in John
Street, Portman Square, which is between the square and Edgware
Road.&nbsp; They were to have forced themselves into the house,
at Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s, while dinner was going on, which they
could easily <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>have done by knocking at the door
and then overpowering the footmen; or, according to another
version, to have assassinated the ministers as they came away in
a body.</p>
<p>The Countess of Caledon, writing, about the same date, to Lady
Elizabeth Stuart, says, &ldquo;Since the Gunpowder Plot there has
been nothing so terrible.&nbsp; Sir Willm. Scott says there was a
plan to set London on fire in twelve places.&nbsp; They only
waited for the signal that the assassination had taken place at
Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Seven thousand persons were ready
that night to act on the signal.&nbsp; We should never have
escaped a Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly the Horsington lunatic&rsquo;s collar might well have
been employed in curtailing the movements of this seditious
native; but the public safety was more effectually secured by
hanging him on May 1st in the same year, 1820. <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a></p>
<p>The church bell bears the date 1754, with founder&rsquo;s
name, &ldquo;Dan Hedderly.&rdquo;&nbsp; I may add that one of the
bells in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Horncastle, has the inscription
&ldquo;Supplicem Deus audit.&nbsp; Daniel Hedderly cast me,
1727.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the present churchyard at Horsington grows
the St. Mary&rsquo;s thistle referred to in a previous chapter,
among the Flora.&nbsp; I find a note with reference to the same
plant growing in a field near Somerford Grange, the farm of the
monks of Christchurch.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is supposed to have been
brought from the Holy Land, and only found near Religious
Houses.&rdquo; <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; The writer happens to know
that, in this case, the plant was imported some 20 years ago from
Kirkstead, where it is now extinct.&nbsp; Had it a tongue to
speak with, it would appeal to the pity of the visitor in the
words &ldquo;Noli me tangere.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bucknall</span> lies barely two miles from
Horsington, to the west.&nbsp; The name (Buckehale in Domesday
Book, or Buckenhall) would seem to indicate a former hall, or
mansion, surrounded by beech trees; <a name="citation161c"></a><a
href="#footnote161c" class="citation">[161c]</a> and in a field,
still called &ldquo;Hallyards,&rdquo; to the south of the
village, there are traces of such a residence, near the farm now
occupied by Mr. W. Carter.&nbsp; This was probably the home of
the Saxon Thorold, Sheriff of Lincoln, <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>and lord of
the demesne, before the Conquest.&nbsp; His daughter, the Lady
Godiva (or God&rsquo;s gift), of Coventry fame, and probably born
here, married Leofric, the powerful Earl of Mercia.&nbsp; She was
a great benefactress to the Church.&nbsp; Thorold gave to the
monastery of St. Guthlac at Croyland, &ldquo;for the salvation of
his soul,&rdquo; land in Bucknall, comprising &ldquo;1 carucate,
<a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a> with 5 villiens, 2 bordars, and 8
soc-men, with another carucate; meadow 120 acres, and wood 50
acres.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two principal features in the village are
now the rectory house and the church.&nbsp; The former, a
substantial old gabled building, standing in a large
old-fashioned garden, probably dates back some 300 years.&nbsp;
By a curious arrangement, in some of the rooms the fireplace
stands in the corner, instead of in the centre of the room
wall.&nbsp; The church, dedicated, like so many others in the
neighbourhood, to St. Margaret, has no very striking
features.&nbsp; Its architecture is mainly Early English, with
some traces of Norman; embattled tower, with four pinnacles, and
conical roof.&nbsp; It has been renovated and improved at various
periods.&nbsp; In 1704 it was re-roofed and considerably
altered.&nbsp; It was thoroughly restored in 1882, at a cost of
about &pound;1,500, the older features being judiciously
retained.&nbsp; The late rector, Rev. E. W. Lutt, introduced a
new Communion table, chancel rails, and lamps.&nbsp; In 1899 a
handsome carved eagle lectern was given by his parishioners and
friends.&nbsp; Under the present rector, Rev. W. H. Benson-Brown,
a beautifully-carved oak reredos, of chaste design, was erected,
and dedicated Sept. 17, 1902.&nbsp; Two coloured windows were
presented, and dedicated Dec. 23, 1903, the subject of one being
St. Margaret, the patron saint of the church; that of the other,
St. Hugh, patron saint of the diocese.&nbsp; The inscription on
the former is &ldquo;To the glory of God, and in loving memory of
Jessie Syme Elsey, who entered into rest May 1st, 1903.&nbsp;
This window was given by her sisters Louisa Pepper and Nancy
Margaret Richardson.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inscription of the other
window is &ldquo;To the glory of God, and in loving memory of
Robert Brown, who entered rest Nov. 21st, 1897, also of Mary Jane
Brown, who entered rest March 22nd, 1903.&nbsp; This window was
given <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>by their son, W. H. Benson-Brown,
Rector.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the Rector&rsquo;s efforts coloured
glass is shortly also to be placed in the chancel east
window.&nbsp; A processional cross was presented to the church as
a thankoffering, by the Rector and Mrs. Brown, on the recovery of
their son, Langton Benson-Brown, after a serious operation, Sept.
11th, 1899.</p>
<p>The churchyard was enlarged, and consecrated by the Bishop,
May 22nd, 1900.</p>
<p>The general plan of the church is nave, with small north and
south aisles, and chancel.&nbsp; At the east end of the south
aisle, in the south wall, is a piscina; a slab of considerable
size below it, indicating that this has been formerly a chantry,
with altar at the east end, lit up by two small windows, one in
the eastern wall, the other over the piscina.&nbsp; In the
easternmost bay of the north arches, which now extends within the
chancel, there is, at the base of the arch moulding, a
nun&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; This, however, is believed to be modern
work, introduced at the restoration.&nbsp; The pulpit is of old
oak, nicely carved, with peculiar Masonic-looking design, the
money for its erection being left by Henry Taylor, Esq., of All
Hallows, Barking, in 1646.&nbsp; The font is hexagonal, having a
simple semi-circular moulding in the centre on four sides, the
other sides being plain.&nbsp; There is a good old oak parish
chest in the tower.&nbsp; The tower, externally, has two good
original gurgoyles, the other two being modern.</p>
<p>The Communion plate was &ldquo;the gift of Mrs. Hannah Ashley,
1786.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the chancel is a pewter alms dish, with the
name &ldquo;Bucknall,&rdquo; and the date, hardly legible,
&ldquo;1680.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bell of the church is evidently
ancient, and has several curious devices graven upon it,
including a Tudor Rose, beneath which are four crosses,
alternating with four capital S&rsquo;s; besides these, there is
a long cross, with upper end branching into a trefoil, its lower
end forming a fork, resting on a circle, on each side being a
smaller stem, slightly foliating at top.</p>
<p>On the east side of the south doorway is an old stone having a
sundial graven on it; now built into masonry which must have come
from some other part of the fabric.&nbsp; Opposite the porch, in
the churchyard, slightly raised above the path, is a large, flat
square stone, nearly a yard broad, and with some moulding
below.&nbsp; This is called &ldquo;the tithe stone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It may have been the base of a churchyard cross; but, as in olden
times the cross often served as a place of barter and business,
it may well also have <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>received the tithes and other dues
belonging to the rector.&nbsp; (See &ldquo;Old Stone
Crosses,&rdquo; by Elias Owen, 1886.)&nbsp; I may add that there
was a similar stone in the churchyard in the neighbouring parish
of Waddingworth.</p>
<p>A list of non-jurors connected with this parish in 1715 has
the following names:&mdash;&ldquo;Susanna Smith, widow, &pound;10
0s. 0d.; William Smith, gent, &pound;30 0s. 0d.; Samuel Martin,
gent., &pound;36 0s. 0d.&rdquo;&nbsp; (It may be remembered that
non-jurors were subject to double taxation, although they erred
in such company as the saintly Bishop Ken and other
prelates.)</p>
<p>It may be further mentioned that in the reign of Charles I. an
inhabitant of this parish, Mr. Thomas Toking (who was also of
Ludgate Hill, London), presented a petition to the King&rsquo;s
Commissioners, showing that he held under the Bishop of Carlisle
a lease of the manor of Horncastle, which had been sequestered
through the default of his predecessor, Rutland Snowden, and
praying for a commission of enquiry.&mdash;State Papers,
Domestic.&nbsp; Chas. I.&nbsp; Vol. 345, No. 42.</p>
<p>The Rector has supplied me with a list of the Rectors of
Bucknall, complete, with the exception of the period between 1608
and 1660.&nbsp; As there are but few parishes of which such a
record is obtainable, I give this below, as interesting.&nbsp; We
notice among them two members of the formerly well-known family
of Dighton; also another known name in Robert Clifton.&nbsp; Evan
Yorke Nepean, Rector 1859&ndash;1868, afterwards succeeded his
uncle in the baronetcy, while the second Rector, who held office
from 1227 to 1244 being named Eusebius, was probably a foreigner,
and, possibly, as was common in those times, though enjoying the
income, never resided in the parish, leaving his duties to be
performed by a scantily-paid substitute.</p>

<p>Tupholme Abbey ruins, about two miles from Bucknall, stand on
the left side of the road leading westward from that place to
Bardney.&nbsp; These require a short notice.&nbsp; This was a
Pr&aelig;monstratensian House, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin,
and founded by Robert, or, as some say, Ranulph, Nova Villa, or
Nevill, who held lands <i>in capite</i> of the King, from the
Conquest, the foundation being further augmented by Alan de
Nevill and Gilbert his brother, temp. Henry II.&nbsp; Tanner
states that at the time of its dissolution by Henry VIII. there
were &ldquo;nine religious&rdquo; in the House, and the
contemporary Leland, in his &ldquo;Collectanea,&rdquo; names two
works which he saw in the Tupholme Library, viz., Fulcherii
Historia and Historiol&aelig; de Britannia fragmentum. <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a>&nbsp; The properties of the Abbey were
very considerable, lying in the parishes of Tupholme, Gautby,
Langton, Franthorpe (where there was a Grange farm), Stixwould,
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Metheringham, Lincoln, Boston, Middle Rasen, Ranby,
West Ashby, Brokelesby, Stourton, Great Coates, Louth, with the
advowson of Stratton Church, and other places.&nbsp; These ample
possessions seem to have bred in the Priors a spirit of
independence, and even of lawlessness; for, at an Inquisition,
held at Lincoln in the 13th century, it was stated that the Prior
of the day had refused to pay his Crown quit rents, and indulged
in other illegal proceedings, besides claiming &ldquo;free
warren&rdquo; over these different manors, which of right
belonged to the King.&nbsp; Another Prior was accused of forgery
and counterfeiting the coin of the realm, <a
name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a> with which he purchased corn and wine
and disposed of them again at a profit.&nbsp; He was also charged
with carrying on an extensive traffic in horn, <a
name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b"
class="citation">[166b]</a> and it is not a little curious, in
connection with this last charge, that a Mr. Pell, whom the
writer, as a boy, knew well, residing at Tupholme Hall, found,
while his men were digging in the Abbey field, great quantities
of the pith, or core, of bullocks&rsquo; horns, all of which had
been divested of the outer coating.&nbsp; Henry II. granted to
the Prior, by Charter, a canal to the Witham; the course of
similar canals can be traced at Stixwould Priory and Kirkstead
Abbey, and thus articles of illegal traffic could be smuggled
down the Witham to foreign lands.&nbsp; At the dissolution the
site of the Abbey was given to Sir Thomas Heneage.</p>
<p>The remains of the Abbey are now small, forming one end,
running north and south, of some farm buildings, with a small
modern house attached, which helps to keep them standing; for,
otherwise, they are so worn away at the lower part, by the cattle
rubbing against them, that they would be in danger of falling;
and of late years such a contingency has been evidently thought
not unlikely, as a railing is now put up outside to keep the
cattle out of danger.&nbsp; There are southward five upper Early
English windows in the remaining fragment, probably the wall of
the Refectory; and two more ornamental <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>windows of
a small chamber, northward, with a small narrow round-headed
window, deeply let in, at the end; with eight round arched
recesses below, one of these being perforated, and forming an
entrance to the refectory from the outside.&nbsp; Fragments of
carved stones are also inserted in a modern wall at the north
end.&nbsp; A local tradition survives, that the place is haunted
by a headless lady; and an instance is related by a labourer
formerly living close by, who, when beating his wife, was so
terrified by an apparition, which in his ignorance he took to be
&ldquo;the Old Lad,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the Devil, that he
henceforth became a reformed character, and never belaboured his
wife again.</p>
<p>There is a short cut over the fields from Stixwould to
Tupholme Priory, available for the pedestrian, but transit for
the carriage is doubtful, as the cart track is a private
accommodation road, though possibly the proverbial &ldquo;silver
key&rdquo; may open the locks.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the
ruins is Tupholme Hall, a large substantial brick building, with
some fine timber about it.&nbsp; The age of this house I do not
know, but some spouting bears date 1789.&nbsp; Tupholme can be
reached by train to Southrey station, with a walk of about a mile
and a half, or from Bardney about two miles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We now pass over two miles in thought, and reach
Bardney.&nbsp; Here we have the largest church (St. Lawrence) in
this neighbourhood; and though for a long time it was left in a
wretched condition, it was restored in 1878 at a cost of
&pound;2,500, and is now in a very good condition.&nbsp; Its
chief features of interest are as follows:&mdash;In the south
wall of the chancel there is a piscina; in the pavement north of
the Communion table is a flat slab of Purbeck marble, with a
cross and the initials C.S., with date 1715.&nbsp; The present
Communion table is formed of a massive slab of Lincoln limestone,
9 feet long, 4 feet in width, and 6 inches in thickness.&nbsp;
Inscribed on this are seven crosses, three at each end and one in
the front centre; they have evidently been scratched with a rude
instrument and are doubtless of early date.&nbsp; The number of
these crosses, seven, would imply that it was dedicated to some
sacred purpose.&nbsp; The stone was found under the floor of the
nave, while operations were going on for the restoration.&nbsp;
It is supposed to have been brought from the Abbey (of which we
shall speak presently), and to have been the tombstone of King
Oswald of Northumbria, who, as the Venerable Bede <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>states (Book iii.. c. vi.), was buried in the Abbey
under the High Altar; although it is known that with the
exception of one hand (which is said to have acquired miraculous
powers) his remains were afterwards removed to Gloucester.&nbsp;
The chancel is built of bricks, which resemble those of
Tattershall and Halstead Hall, and commonly called
&ldquo;Flemish;&rdquo; but it is likely that, as in the case of
the two other buildings just named, they were made in the
neighbourhood, where there have been very extensive brick and
tile kilns, of so old a date as to have given its name to a small
stream, which is called &ldquo;Tile-house Beck.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
chancel has angels between the main beams of the roof.&nbsp; In
the chancel arch south wall, on the eastern side, are initials
scratched, with dates 1443 and 1668.&nbsp; The nave has north and
south aisles with five bays, and Early English arches and
columns, the plinths of these columns being unusually
high&mdash;over three feet, and those on the south being slightly
higher than those on the north.&nbsp; The aisle windows are
debased.&nbsp; The timber beams in the roof are of strong good
oak; plain, except a central floriated device; the general
boarding being of pine.&nbsp; The east window has five lights,
with fourteen divisions above, within the low arch.&nbsp; The
register dates from 1653.&nbsp; The Communion plate is good, its
date 1569.&nbsp; The tower is massive, broad, and low, with here
and there a relic of Norman zigzag work built into the
walls.&nbsp; There are four bells, large, and of good tone, the
weight of the largest being just short of one ton.&nbsp; Their
inscriptions are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Soli Deo gloria (Churchwardens) T. T. &amp; W. K.
1644.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) W. S. (with Fleur de lys) Deus . . . 1670.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Sanctus Dominus . . . 1663.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; Jhesus be our spede.&nbsp; E. E.&nbsp; R.R. a
Rose.&nbsp; 1615.</p>
<p>The Abbey of Bardney, of which now nothing remains <i>in
situ</i> except a sepulchral barrow, dates from the Saxon
Heptarchy, being one of the oldest in the kingdom.&nbsp; It was
first built, says Dugdale <a name="citation168a"></a><a
href="#footnote168a" class="citation">[168a]</a> by King
Ethelred, who himself, in 705, quitted his throne of Mercia, and,
retiring to Bardney, became its Abbot for the last 13 years of
his life.&nbsp; The name of the actual founder, however, is lost
in obscurity.&nbsp; Leland says <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a> that the monks
themselves did not know it.&nbsp; The barrow referred to is
called, to <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>this day, the
&ldquo;coney-garth&rdquo; or &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
enclosure,&rdquo; and Ethelred is supposed to have been buried
there.&nbsp; The Abbey was destroyed in 870, by the Danes, under
their leaders Inguar and Hubba, and 300 monks slaughtered before
the altar.&nbsp; It was re-built 200 years later, and re-endowed,
by Gilbert de Gaunt, the powerful Norman baron whose bounteous
acts we have referred to more than once; and his son, Walter de
Gaunt, in 1115, confirmed &ldquo;to the church and monastery of
St. Peter, St. Paul and St. Oswald, all those lands and
possessions which his father had given in pure and perpetual alms
to the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all this was afterwards confirmed
by Henry I. <a name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a"
class="citation">[169a]</a>&nbsp; It was a very wealthy
establishment of the Benedictine order.&nbsp; The superior was
one of the twenty-five mitred Abbots in England; he was called
the &ldquo;Lord of Lindsey,&rdquo; had a seat in the House of
Lords, and a palace in London.&nbsp; At the time when the body of
Oswald, King of Northumbria, was buried here, there were 300
monks in the Abbey, says Dugdale.&nbsp; I have mentioned that
when the body of King Oswald was afterwards transferred to
Gloucester, a hand was retained, which acquired miraculous
powers; the versions as regards this vary, but there is a legend
that Aidan, Bishop of Lindisfarne was dining with Oswald, there
being a silver dish on the royal table, well replenished, when
the king&rsquo;s almoner announced &ldquo;that there was a crowd
of mendicants begging at the gate.&nbsp; The king immediately
ordered the whole of the meat, and the dish itself, to be divided
among them.&nbsp; This generosity so struck the bishop that he
grasped the king&rsquo;s right hand, exclaiming that &ldquo;it
was impossible that a hand so munificent should ever
perish,&rdquo; and the monks assert that it never did.&nbsp;
After his death it was deposited as a holy relic in St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church at Bebba, now called Bamborough.&nbsp;
Thence it was purloined by a monk of Peterborough (says William
of Malmsbury) and deposited in the Abbey there, where it is said,
by Nicholas Harpsfield, to have remained in a perfect state till
after the Reformation. <a name="citation169b"></a><a
href="#footnote169b" class="citation">[169b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>In the Record &ldquo;Testa de Nevill&rdquo; (p. 338) it
is stated that, besides the lands given to the Abbey by Gilbert
de Gaunt, in Bardenay, Surraye (Southrey), An-Goteby (Gautby),
and elsewhere, Roger de Marmion (ancestor of the Dymokes of
Scrivelsby) also endowed it with certain lands.&nbsp; The Abbots
held the advowsons of, or pensions from, the churches of Bardney,
Barton-on-Humber, Sotby, Falkingham, Wlacot, Skendleby, Partney,
Frisby, Lusby, Baumber, Edlington, and half a dozen more.</p>
<p>Of Bardney I have only one more particular to mention, a
modern miracle:&mdash;In the year 1898, in the hamlet of
Southrey, an outlying part of the parish, a church was built,
where there had been none before, to accommodate 90 people; the
builders, as in the historic case of St. Hugh of Avalon, carrying
his hod at the erection of his own cathedral, were the clergy,
assisted by the parishioners generally, all carting being done by
the farmers; and the greatest zeal and interest being shewn by
all parties.&nbsp; It is a wooden structure, on a concrete
foundation.&nbsp; The font was brought from the vicarage,
probably being of the 15th century.</p>
<p>As I stand on this barrow, &ldquo;coney-garth,&rdquo; with the
remains mouldering beneath me, blending with their kindred earth,
of the saintly Ethelred, who in his singular devotion exchanged
the crown of a king for the mitre of an abbot, I command a view,
probably unrivalled in the world.&nbsp; In the near distance
north-east are the buildings which occupy the site of the vaccary
of Bardney Abbey, still called Bardney Dairies, and said to have
been the original position of the abbey itself, before its
destruction by the Danes.&nbsp; North-westward, beyond the woods,
between two and three miles away, are the crumbling remains of
Barlings Abbey, whose last abbot, Macharell (under the name of
Captain Cobbler), headed the Lincolnshire Rebellion, in the reign
of Henry VIII., and for his offence was executed, along with the
contemporary Abbot of Kirkstead.&nbsp; In the next village but
one to the west formerly stood the Priory of Minting, of which
only mounds and ponds survive.&nbsp; To the north of this was the
Priory of Benedictine Nuns at Stainfield; while a few short miles
again beyond this to the east was Bullington Priory; and crowning
the north-western horizon stands the majestic Cathedral of
Lincoln, around which clustered in its immediate proximity
fourteen monasteries; truly a region once rich beyond compare in
monastic <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>institutions; the homes of devotion,
if also, unhappily, of error and superstition; but the almost
sole sources in their day &ldquo;of light and leading&rdquo;; but
for whom we should now know but little or nothing of the distant
past, since it was the monks who made and preserved for us our
historic records, <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a> they who
multiplied our old MSS., they who were our great agriculturists,
and they above all who handed down to us the Word of Life.&nbsp;
Not far off to the east is a wood, commonly called
&ldquo;Horsetaker wood,&rdquo; but the term is really
&ldquo;Auster-acre,&rdquo; the eastern-acre or field (Latin,
Australis ager); as at Bawtry there is land called by the similar
name, &ldquo;Auster-field,&rdquo; and we have most of us heard of
the battle of Austerlitz, when Napoleon conquered the forces of
Austria and Russia, in 1805.&nbsp; To the north lies another
wood, known as &ldquo;Hardy-gang&rdquo; wood, a name derived from
the following local tradition:&mdash;Once upon a time a wild man
lived in the fastnesses of this wood (the woods about here were,
within the writer&rsquo;s recollection, much more extensive than
they now are); he wore no clothing; was covered with hair; and
was the terror of the neighbourhood, raiding the sheep and
cattle, and carrying off occasionally a child.&nbsp; At length
his maraudings became so excessive that a number of men banded
together, binding themselves not to rest until they had rid the
country of this monster in human form.&nbsp; They had a hard task
to perform, but at length they did it, and their name of
&ldquo;the hardy gang&rdquo; was passed on to the wood
itself.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Continuing our ramble, a walk of some five miles
eastward, partly through fields, by a wide and evidently ancient
footpath, trod, doubtless, by many a monk of old, and skirting
the above-named Auster-acre wood, we arrive at the small and
scattered village of Gautby, the property of the Vyners.&nbsp; We
are here in a region of fine and stately timber, a suitable
position for a large, and handsome residence; but the hall was
demolished several years ago, and only the gardens remain,
enclosed by a high wall.&nbsp; In such a place, and under such
patronage, we should expect to find the church a handsome fabric,
but, on the contrary, the visitor will be surprised to see a
mean, brick, small structure, with no pretensions whatever to
architectural beauty.&nbsp; The old square pews are still
retained, with some open sittings, all of oak, but without
ornament; pulpit and reading-desk, in keeping with these; the
font is of wood with marble basin, small, and of no beauty.&nbsp;
A small wooden gallery, for singers, over the west door, reminds
one of the days when our country choirs were accompanied by
hautboy, clarionet and fiddle, and almost the only hymns were
&ldquo;Tate and Brady.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chancel is almost
entirely paved with tombstones of the Vyners.&nbsp; One of these
records the murder of F. G. Vyner, Esq., by brigands in Greece,
in the year 1870.&nbsp; On the north and south sides of the
Communion table are raised monuments, on which are semi-recumbent
figures in stone.&nbsp; The inscription on the northern sepulchre
runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;At the instance of Thomas Vyner,
Esqvire, Clerke of the Patents, piously desiring to preserve the
memorie of his dear Father, Sr Thomas Vyner deceased, His
Executor Sr Robert Vyner, Knight and Baronet, caused this
monument to be set up Anno. Dom. 1672.&rdquo;&nbsp; The south
inscription is, &ldquo;To the memorie of Thomas Vyner Esqr,
second sonne of Sr Thomas Vyner, Knt. &amp; Baronet, by Dame
Honour, daughter of George Humble Esqr, of this Parish, His
second wife, this monument was erected, at the charge of Sr
Robert Vyner, Knt and Baronet, sole executor of his last will and
Testament.&nbsp; Ano. Dni. 1673.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The founder of the family of Vyner was Sir Robert, a wealthy
London merchant, who, like his father before him, lent money to
ruined Royalists, doubtless at a rate of interest which well
repaid him.&nbsp; He was <i>fond of his sovereign</i>, in more
senses than one, as is shewn by the following anecdote given in
the &ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; No. 462:&mdash;When Sir Robert Vyner
was Lord Mayor, in 1675, he entertained Charles II. in <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>the Guild-hall; and this he did with so profuse
hospitality, and withal repeatedly toasting the royal family,
that he soon began to treat his sovereign with a familiarity
unduly loving.&nbsp; The king understood very well how to
extricate himself from such a difficulty, and with a hint to the
company to avoid ceremony, he stole away and made for his coach,
standing in the Guild-hall yard.&nbsp; But Sir Robert liked his
Majesty&rsquo;s company so well that he pursued him, and catching
the king by the hand, he cried out, with a round oath,
&ldquo;Sire, you shall stay and take t&rsquo; other
bottle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles, recognising the inevitable, put a
good face on the matter, and, looking at him kindly, with a
graceful air repeated this line of the old song,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that&rsquo;s drunk is as great as a
king.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He immediately returned and complied with the invitation. <a
name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a></p>
<p>In the park at Gautby there stood for many years an equestrian
statue, of which the history is somewhat ludicrous.&nbsp; It
passed for a statue of Charles II.&nbsp; Sir Robert Vyner, the
hero of the above anecdote, presented it to the City of London,
in 1675; and it was placed in the Stocks Market, in honour of his
Majesty.&nbsp; The royal horseman bestrides a warlike steed,
which is trampling under foot the figure of a turbanned
Turk.&nbsp; This seems hardly an appropriate mode of representing
a sovereign, who, so far from thirsting for deeds of war, could
drink wine and play cards when the Dutch were burning our
shipping in the Thames close by.&nbsp; The Stocks Market was
eventually demolished, when the statue was transferred to Gautby
Park, the Lincolnshire seat of the donor, whence it has in late
years been transferred to the Yorkshire seat of the
Vyners&mdash;Newby Park, near Ripon.&nbsp; It had been originally
intended to represent John Sobieski, King of Poland, who was
regarded as the saviour of Europe from the Mussulman power; and
for him, the Turk trampled under foot was a fitting emblem.&nbsp;
When the statue was taken down in 1738, the following satiric
lines were circulated and sung in the streets:&mdash;</p>
<h3><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>&ldquo;The last dying speech and
confession of the Horse at Stock&rsquo;s Market.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Ye whimsical people of London&rsquo;s fair town<br
/>
Who one day put up, what the next day pull down;<br />
Full sixty-one years, have I stood in this place,<br />
And never, till now, met with any disgrace!<br />
What affront to crowned heads could you offer more bare,<br />
Than to pull down a king to make room for a mayor?<br />
The great Sobieski, on horse with long tail,<br />
I first represented, when set up for sale;<br />
A Turk, as you see, was placed under my feet,<br />
To prove o&rsquo;er the Sultan my conquest compleat.<br />
Next, when against monarchy all were combined,<br />
I, for your Protector, old Noll, was designed.<br />
When the King was restored, you then, in a trice,<br />
Called me Charly the Second; and, by way of device,<br />
Said the old whiskered Turk had Oliver&rsquo;s face,<br />
Though you know to be conquered he ne&rsquo;er had the
disgrace.<br />
Three such persons as these on one horse to ride,<br />
A Hero, Usurper, and King, all astride:&mdash;<br />
Such honours were mine; though now forced to retire,<br />
Perhaps my next change may be still something higher,<br />
From a fruitwoman&rsquo;s market, I may leap to a spire.<br />
As the market is moved, I am forced to retreat;<br />
I could stay there no longer, with nothing to eat.<br />
Now the herbs and the greens are all carried away,<br />
I must go unto those who will find me in hay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old horse, after serving varied purposes, and more than
one &ldquo;flitting,&rdquo; finds literally &ldquo;a green old
age&rdquo; in his &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; in the great horse
county; a standing memorial, in stone, of a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;zeal&rdquo; <i>not</i> &ldquo;tempered with
knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his memory is not allowed to perish,
for in the neighbouring training stables a favourite name among
the fleet racers is Sobieski.</p>
<p>A pleasant walk of less than a mile over meadows, or
&ldquo;Ings,&rdquo; brings us to the village of Minting, the last
syllable of its name, possibly, being derived from the said
&ldquo;Ings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, as has been already mentioned,
formerly existed a Priory of Benedictine monks, a
&ldquo;cell&rdquo; or offshoot of the Gallic monastery of St.
Benedict super Loira, and founded in 1129 by Ranulph de
Meschines, Earl of Chester.&nbsp; No buildings remain
above-ground, but they must have been very extensive, as mound
and hollow and stew pond cover an area of four or five
acres.&nbsp; The benefice is in the gift of St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge.&nbsp; The church, previously a very poor
structure, was restored by the Vicar, the Rev. F. Bashforth, in
1863, at a cost of over &pound;800, the late Mr. Ewan Christian
being the architect.&nbsp; The font is modern, but handsome, in
form hexagonal.&nbsp; There is a north aisle with three bays and
Norman arches.&nbsp; Three windows in the north wall and two in
the south are debased.&nbsp; The east window is a good sample of
the Perpendicular, <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>and on the outside has figureheads
of king and queen, as terminals of the moulding.&nbsp; A curious
slab, carved on both sides, formerly lay loose in the porch,
having been part of a churchyard cross.&nbsp; At the restoration
it was cut into two sections, and these were placed on the east
wall of the nave, north and south of the chancel arch, thus
shewing the two carved surfaces.&nbsp; The device on the northern
one is a rude representation of the Crucifixion; the
Saviour&rsquo;s legs are crossed, and a figure stands on either
side, probably St. John and the Virgin.&nbsp; Below is a
rudely-cut foliated pattern.&nbsp; The design of the slab on the
south, formerly the back, is also rude foliation.&nbsp; On the
north wall of the chancel there is an oval brass tablet to the
memory of Gulielmus Chapman, of which one is tempted to say that,
unless the individual commemorated was an almost more than human
embodiment of all the virtues, the author of the epitaph must
have acted on the principle recommended by the poet Matthew
Prior,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Be to his virtues very kind,<br />
And to his faults a little blind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Gulielmus Chapman, Probus,
Doctus, Lepidus, Facundus, Hic jacet.&nbsp; Pietate, Fidelitate,
Benignitate, Modesti&acirc;, Nulli Secundus, Hanc Vicariam bis 20
et octo annos tenuit.&nbsp; Clarus in Umbra, Rar&acirc; in
senectute Emicuit, Die 14 Aprilis decessit, Anno &AElig;tat. 82,
Anno Dom. 1722.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The villagers of this parish, 100 years ago, are said to have
exercised the art of weaving on a considerable scale, and one of
the writer&rsquo;s parishioners states that his grandmother lived
there and had a hand-loom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A walk of less than two miles, chiefly across the fields,
brings us to Wispington.&nbsp; We have already mentioned <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a> the presence here of moats, mounds,
and portions of a former old mansion of the Phillips family,
utilized in existing farm buildings.&nbsp; We have only now to
notice the church, which does not call for much remark.&nbsp; It
was rebuilt on the site, and partly of the materials, of the
previously-existing church, in 1863, at a cost of &pound;1,500,
by the Rev. C. P. Terrott, late vicar, and one of our greatest
local antiquaries.&nbsp; He himself designed the font and stone
pulpit, and also executed the devices which adorned them,
representing groups of different animals named in the
Bible.&nbsp; The <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>tower is supported on buttresses, on
a principle adopted from the church of Old Woodhall, which is
peculiar, but simple and effective.&nbsp; In the vestry there is
a slab, in the floor, of a former rector, John Hetherset, holding
a chalice with hands in many-buttoned gloves.&nbsp; Built into
the vestry wall are the capitals of two small Norman pillars,
which were dug up near the church, and doubtless formed part of
the older Norman building.&nbsp; Propped up against the vestry
wall is a Jacobean altar-stone, formerly on the Communion table,
one of the very few in England.&nbsp; The two medi&aelig;val
bells are dedicated to the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The east window has
modern coloured glass, the subject being the crucifixion, and
scenes in the life of our Saviour.&nbsp; In the north wall of the
nave is a window of coloured glass, commorative of the late
vicar, C. P. Terrot; and in the south wall of the chancel is
another, commemorating his son, Capt. Charles Terrott; in the
south nave wall, near the font, is a brass tablet, with the
Tyrwhitt arms, erected by the late Rev. Beauchamp St. John
Tyrwhitt, vicar, in memory of his brother Robert.&nbsp; The west
window is of coloured glass, the subject being St. Margaret and
St. John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Edlington Church (St. Helen&rsquo;s)&mdash;the village being a
very scattered one, with scarcely two houses
contiguous&mdash;stands to the east, some two miles from
Wispington.&nbsp; It was rebuilt, except the lower part of the
tower, in 1859&ndash;60.&nbsp; The pulpit, reading desk, lectern,
and sittings are all of oak, modern and plain, but
substantial.&nbsp; There are three bells.&nbsp; Edlington park is
nicely wooded with some good timber, though much of it has been
felled of late years.&nbsp; There was formerly a good residence
on the northern rising ground, but it was pulled down &ldquo;in
the forties&rdquo; by the then owner, J. Hassard Short, Esq., and
only the kitchen gardens and fish ponds remain.&nbsp; In a field
near at hand there were found, several years ago, a number of
heaps of oxbones, each heap also containing an ancient urn,
supposed to have been connected with Roman sacrifices; but, as
Dr. Oliver <a name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a> derives the name Edlington from
Eiddileg, a mystic character in the Bardic mythology, these may
be the remnants of some other heathen superstition.</p>
<p>A walk across the park and over a couple of fields southward
brings us to the village of Thimbleby, which consists of a
&ldquo;street&rdquo; of <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>small
cottages and two or three larger dwelling-houses.&nbsp; There is
here an old manor, called &ldquo;Hall-garth,&rdquo; with an
interesting old house with gables, thatched roof, some panelled
rooms, a large fish pond, an old-time garden with yew hedges
fantastically trimmed, and a fine old tree or two.&nbsp; In a
field called &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; at the east end of the
parish, are some fine trees, remnants of a former avenue.&nbsp;
The ancient well, said to be Roman, in the rectory grounds, has
already been mentioned.&nbsp; The church was re-fashioned in
1879, and an old, nondescript, flat-ceiled structure was
converted into a substantial and well-designed edifice of Early
Decorated style, with clock-tower and good clock, which gives out
its notes of time to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We are now within a mile of Horncastle; somewhat weary after
our long explorations, let us wend our way on to the old town,
and seek rest and refreshment at the well-appointed and almost
historic hostel which is ready to welcome us beneath &ldquo;ye
Signe of ye Bull.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>Re-invigorated, after the prolonged explorations of the last
chapter, by a much-needed rest at the hostel of &ldquo;The
Bull,&rdquo; we now prepare for our final round of visitation
among the still remaining objects of interest in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; And first we may seek enlightenment as to
the meaning of &ldquo;the sign&rdquo; of our inn, for such signs
are ofttimes significant.&nbsp; For this we have not far to
go.&nbsp; Looking out of the window of the snug little parlour we
are occupying, we see before us what an Irishman might call a
triangular square&mdash;a sort of &ldquo;Trivium,&rdquo; where
three ways meet, and where men not seldom congregate for trivial
converse, although on market days it is the scene of busy barter,
and at mart, or fair, transactions in horse, and other, flesh are
negotiated with dealers of many kindreds, peoples, and tongues;
but more of this anon.&nbsp; On the far side of this open space,
&ldquo;the Red Lion&rdquo; bravely faces us, lashing its tail in
rivalry.&nbsp; In the centre we notice a large lamppost (recently
erected by the Urban Council; in 1897).&nbsp; At this spot, well
within living memory, was to be seen a large iron ring, securely
embedded in a stone in the pavement, of goodly dimensions.&nbsp;
This was &ldquo;the Bull King,&rdquo; and the open space still
perpetuates the name.&nbsp; Here the ancient sport of
bull-baiting was practised annually for the brutal, but
thoughtless, delectation of the people of town and country side.
<a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a>&nbsp; I find a note that on April 21,
1887, I conversed with an old woman, and, as a link with what is
passed, never to return, I may here give her name,&mdash;Judith
Thornley, daughter of W. Elvin, farmer, of Baumber,&mdash;and
then 84 years of age, who remembered the Bull ring, as I also do,
and who, as a child, raised on her father&rsquo;s shoulders to
see over the crowd, witnessed more than one bull-baiting.&nbsp;
On one such occasion she saw a woman gored by the bull, its horns
piercing her bowels, although it was secured by the nose to the
ring, the crowd being so great that she was thrust within the
dangerous area by those pressing upon her from behind.&nbsp;
This, <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>she reckoned, would be about the
year 1809 or 1810.&nbsp; As Mr. Weir, in his &ldquo;History of
Horncastle,&rdquo; dated 1820, makes no reference to this
practice, we may assume that the old lady was about right in her
calculation.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite our hostel may be noticed, at the corner, a
saddler&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; This was established in the year
1760, and, situated as the shop is in the centre of the great
fair, Messrs. H. and W. Sharp receive orders for various
articles, in connection with horseflesh, from foreign as well as
English customers.&nbsp; Conversing with the head of this firm at
the time of this writing, I found that within the last few months
they had received commissions not only from various parts of
England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, but from Belgium, Norway,
France and Germany; some handsome harness, which I recently saw
being made by them, was for Berlin.&nbsp; Opposite the entrance
to the Bull is a smaller inn, the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; which is thatched; one hundred years ago nearly
every house in the town was thatched, and by the terms of the
Will by which this particular inn was devised to the present
owner, it is required that it should always remain
thatched.&nbsp; This, surely, is a proviso which might be
legitimately ignored; and, doubtless, in a few years&rsquo; time,
thatching will be a lost art.&nbsp; The street to the right,
running north, and now named North Street, was formerly called
&ldquo;The Mill-stones,&rdquo; from two old abandoned millstones
which lay near the northern end of it.&nbsp; Half-way up this
street, a back street branching off to the left is called
&ldquo;Conging Street,&rdquo; and formerly near it was a well
named &ldquo;Conging Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; This term is derived from
the old Norman-French <i>cong&eacute;</i>, a permission, or
licence; from very early times the lord of the manor levied a
toll on all who wished to traffic at the great fairs which were
established by ancient charters of the Sovereign.&nbsp; There
formerly stood, near the present Dispensary, an old house called
the &ldquo;Conging House,&rdquo; where these tolls were paid for
the licence to trade. <a name="citation179"></a><a
href="#footnote179" class="citation">[179]</a></p>
<p>A curious custom which formerly prevailed in <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>the town at the time of the great fairs, and which
continued to later than the middle of the 19th century, was the
opening of what were termed &ldquo;Bough-houses,&rdquo; for the
entertainment of visitors.&nbsp; Horncastle has still an
unusually large number of licensed public-houses, and not many
years ago had nearly twice the number, many of them with
extensive stabling, for the accommodation of man and beast, at
the fairs for which it is famous; but, beyond these, it was a
custom, from time immemorial, that any private house could sell
beer without a licence, if a bough, or bush, was hung out at the
door. <a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a>&nbsp; This, no doubt, gave rise to the
old saying, &ldquo;good wine needs no bush,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
the quarters where it was sold would need no bough or bush hung
out to advertise its merits, as they would be a matter of common
bruit.&nbsp; This, as was to be expected, was a privilege liable
to be abused, and, only to give one instance, a couple living in
the town and owning a name not unknown at Woodhall Spa, are said
to have ordered for themselves a goodly barrel of beer to be
ready for the fair, but, the barrel having been delivered two or
three days before the fair commenced, they had themselves tried
its merits so frequently, that when the day arrived there was
none left to sell, and the barrel was unpaid for, with no means
received to pay for it, while they themselves were no better for
the transaction.</p>
<p>On &ldquo;the Millstones,&rdquo; about half-way up the street,
a friend of the writer witnessed, in the <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>forties, a
man selling his wife by auction, <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a> who stood on the
top of a barrel, with a halter round her neck, and a crowd
collected round, examining her merits, as might not long ago have
been seen in a slave market in Egypt.&nbsp; She was sold for
&pound;30, in the street, opposite a small inn then called
&ldquo;The Horse and Jocky,&rdquo; and kept by a man commonly
called Banty Marshall.&nbsp; I am not aware that it is more than
a coincidence, that, although the inn has now a different name, a
device in the window represents a cat on a barrel.&nbsp; The
parish stocks stood at the top of this street, where the Court
House now stands; they were last used in 1859, and were only
removed on its erection in 1865.&nbsp; The present writer can
remember seeing persons confined in the stocks; as also in a
neighbouring village, where the parish clerk, after his return
from the Saturday market, not uncommonly was put in the stocks,
to fit him for his Sunday duties.</p>
<p>In connection with the fairs, deeds of violence were not
unknown.&nbsp; At a house on the north side of the Market-place,
which was formerly the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; inn, but
is now occupied by a veterinary surgeon, while alterations were
being made, two skeletons were found under the bricks of the
kitchen floor.&nbsp; The men had doubtless been murdered for
their money at fair-time, and the bodies placed there for
concealment.&nbsp; Of the cheating practised at the fairs I can
give a sample or two.&nbsp; It is recorded, I believe, that the
late Dr. Dealtry, Archdeacon of Calcutta, preaching on the
different ideas of honesty or fraud, gave point to his argument
by a humorous illustration.&nbsp; &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;my worthy friend, who occupies the reading desk
beneath me, would see no dishonesty in misrepresenting the
qualities of a horse he wished to sell, even to his dearest
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; And honesty has by no means always been
deemed the best policy in the streets of Horncastle.&nbsp; Edmund
Yates, in his personal &ldquo;Recollections,&rdquo; relates that
he was dining with the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Alexander
Cockburn, when his host told the following story:&mdash;A man saw
a handsome-looking horse at Horncastle Fair, and was astonished
at the low price asked for it.&nbsp; After some chaffering, he
bought it, taking it without <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>a
warranty.&nbsp; Having paid his money, he gave an extra five
shillings to the groom, and asked what was the matter with the
horse that he was sold so cheap.&nbsp; After some hesitation, the
man said that the horse was a perfect animal, but for two
faults.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two faults,&rdquo; said the buyer,
&ldquo;then tell me one of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;One,&rdquo;
said the groom, &ldquo;is, that when you turn him out, in a
field, he is very hard to catch.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo;
said the buyer, &ldquo;does not matter to me, as I never turn my
horses out.&nbsp; Now for the other fault.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The other,&rdquo; said the groom, scratching his head and
looking sly, &ldquo;the other is, that when you&rsquo;ve caught
him he&rsquo;s not worth a rap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another story is as follows:&mdash;Some yeans ago a
Lincolnshire clergyman, advanced in years, had an old horse which
had run in his antiquated carriage from being four years old,
till he was fourteen or fifteen.&nbsp; He would still have
satisfied his master, but that he acquired a very bad habit, to
which, like other old animals not four-legged, he obstinately
adhered.&nbsp; He would jump over the dyke (the locality being in
the marshes) into a neighbour&rsquo;s field.&nbsp; The said
neighbour complained of this so often that the pastor decided to
sell.&nbsp; The old coachman took the horse to Horncastle Fair
and sold him for &pound;26.&nbsp; The old gentleman and his
coachman then looked about the fair for another that would suit
them.&nbsp; They presently saw a horse of the same size and style
as the old favourite just sold, but with shorter mane and tail,
and lacking the star on the forehead which marked the old
horse.&nbsp; They asked, the price, and were told it was
&pound;40.&nbsp; After much haggling the horse was bought for
&pound;35, and his reverence drove home with the new
purchase.&nbsp; After tea his wife said, &ldquo;Well, so you have
not sold?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;we have, and have got a younger and more spirited animal,
very like the old sinner, but with shorter mane and tail, and no
star on his forehead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
wife, &ldquo;I think you were taken in, for the new horse is
already, like the old one, grazing in neighbour Brown&rsquo;s
field&rdquo;; and there, sure enough, he was.&nbsp; The dealer
had docked the tail, trimmed the mane, and dyed the white star
brown; and had &ldquo;gingered&rdquo; the old horse till he
played up like a colt.&nbsp; His reverence, in short, had been
&ldquo;sold,&rdquo; and the old sinner had been returned on his
hands with the loss of &pound;10.</p>
<p>My third story relates to a former Vicar of Horncastle, Dr.
Loddington, who died in 1724, <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>but whose
name survives on one of the church bells, cast during his
incumbency.</p>
<p>We are told, on authority, <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a> that at one time
all kinds of traffic went on within St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,
and its precincts, in London.&nbsp; It was the common lounge of
gallants and their female friends; and even a horse might be
bought there; and such a transaction actually did take place in
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Horncastle.&nbsp; The Vicar had a
chestnut mare which he wished to sell.&nbsp; Two dealers at the
fair bid for her up to &pound;35, which he refused to take.&nbsp;
Sitting together at breakfast on the Sunday morning at their inn,
Brown said to Robinson, &ldquo;I bet you a bottle of wine I buy
that mare of the Vicar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Done,&rdquo;
said Robinson.&nbsp; They both went to church, which was more
than many dealers do nowadays.&nbsp; Brown took his seat just
under the pulpit.&nbsp; Robinson, not knowing this, sat near the
porch, intending to intercept the Vicar as he went out.&nbsp; The
sermon ended, Brown waited till the Vicar descended from the
pulpit; as he reached the bottom step of the stairs, Brown went
to him and said, &ldquo;That was a good sermon, but your
reverence has not yet sold that mare; the fair is over, and I am
leaving in the afternoon.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you take the
&pound;35?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never get a better
bid.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Vicar thought for a moment, and then
whispered, &ldquo;You may have her.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went out, was
met in the porch by Robinson, who found that he was too late, and
owed Brown a bottle of wine; his only consolation was that he
resolved himself to drink the better half of it.</p>
<p>At these fairs good bargains may be made by one who has an eye
to the points of a horse, and can use his opportunities.&nbsp;
The writer knew a curate in the south-west of Lincolnshire, whose
stipend was &pound;50 a year.&nbsp; He came regularly every year,
for many years, to the August fair.&nbsp; His first purchase was
a young horse, for which be gave the whole of his year&rsquo;s
stipend, &pound;50.&nbsp; He kept it a year, and hunted it.&nbsp;
I have ridden with him, when mounted on that horse, with the
Belvoir hounds, and the next year he sold it for &pound;300, a
pretty good percentage on the original outlay.&nbsp; A cousin of
the writer picked out a young horse from a number and gave
&pound;24 for it; he afterwards refused to take &pound;300 for
it, offered by &ldquo;Lord Henry&rdquo;; but he lent it to his
lordship occasionally.&nbsp; Another, which he bought cheap, and
for which he refused &pound;400, <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>broke its
leg in jumping the river Bain, in a Horncastle steeplechase and
had to be shot on the spot.&nbsp; Both these horses I have ridden
to hounds, the one a bay, the other black.</p>
<p>Connected with the fairs is the so-called
&ldquo;Statutes,&rdquo; a day in May for hiring servants.&nbsp;
It was formerly the one general holiday in the year, but now that
the Bank Holidays have been established, the statute-day is
dwindling in its proportions.&nbsp; Of old all the servant girls,
and all the clodhoppers from the country, used to gather in the
town dressed in galore fashion, crowding the Bull-ring.&nbsp;
Anyone who wanted a servant, as an old farmer once told the
writer was his invariable custom, used to walk into the crowd and
hire the first lass against whom he stumbled.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;fasten-penny,&rdquo; a silver coin, was then given, and
the bargain was then struck.&nbsp; Wild beast shows, and
enormities such as lambs with two heads or a dozen legs, and
other attractions, were provided, and the day ended with music
and dancing at the different inns in the town; some of the
proceedings having after-effects not desirable.&nbsp; At the
present time, when there is more regard for our domestic servants
and their characters, and cheap postage prevails, this mode of
haphazard engagement has nearly died out, and the Statute will
soon be a thing of the past.&nbsp; It was first enacted by Ed.
III. in 1351; again by 13th Richard II., and, in later times, was
held under &ldquo;a precept&rdquo; from the Chief Constable of
the Division.&nbsp; To those who wish to read a humorous and
graphic description of the doings on this day, in comparatively
recent times, I would recommend the poem &ldquo;Neddy and Sally;
or, The Statute Day,&rdquo; by John Brown, &ldquo;the Horncastle
Laureate, <a name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> of which I can here give only the
opening lines, which breathe of the spirit inspiring the
occasion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cum, Sall!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time we started
now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yon&rsquo;s Farmer Haycock&rsquo;s lasses reddy,<br
/>
An&rsquo; maister says he&rsquo;ll milk the cow.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say soa, did he,

<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>There have not been wanting, in this old town, some
eccentric characters, whose doings have been peculiar, and have
been traditionally preserved for the entertainment of a rising
generation.&nbsp; Of these two or three may be recorded here, but
for obvious reasons I avoid mentioning names.&nbsp; One
individual, exulting in his strength, undertook, for a wager,
some time in the thirties, to drag a dung cart from Lincoln to
Horncastle, a distance of 21 miles, and successfully accomplished
the feat in eight hours, but he is said to have suffered from
h&aelig;morrhage for the rest of his days.&nbsp; Another man made
a bet that he would start from Lincoln on horseback when the moon
rose there, and would have his horse in his own stable at
Horncastle before the moon had risen there.&nbsp; Lincoln being
on a hill, the moon would be seen earlier there than at
Horncastle, which lay in a hollow.&nbsp; As he galloped along he
is said to have shouted, &ldquo;Now me, now moon,&rdquo; as the
chances seemed at intervals for or against the one or the
other.&nbsp; He just, however, missed the success which he might
have achieved, as he had to pull up, late in the evening, at the
toll-bar on the Lincoln road, about a mile from Horncastle, the
toll-bar keeper being in bed; and this slight delay caused his
failure, for, as he opened his stable door, he saw the moon
shining in a bucket of water which was standing ready for his
steed.&nbsp; The writer is informed that one, if not both, of
these individuals was considered to be a little
&ldquo;short&rdquo; of the full modicum of brains.&nbsp; Another
person, still resident in the town, remembers the burning, in the
street, of the effigies of Bayock and Demont, two of the
witnesses in the trial of Queen Caroline, in 1820.&nbsp; They
were Italians.&nbsp; There were great rejoicings and
illuminations, in London and throughout the country, on Her
Majesty&rsquo;s acquittal; and this was the demonstration of
Horncastrians.&nbsp; An old song was popular at the time,
beginning thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>False witnesses from Italy, they came to London
town;<br />
And all they had against her was to keep her from the crown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wharrie, a shoemaker in the town, was inspired to preach a
sermon in the Bull-ring, from a cart, denouncing the trial.&nbsp;
This sermon was printed, and a copy was long in the possession of
my informant.</p>
<p>A character of a higher type than those yet named, was the
late proprietor and manager of &ldquo;The Bull&rdquo; hostel, at
which we are now supposed to be staying, Mr. Clement James <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Caswell, a genial, generous, and cultivated
gentleman.&nbsp; He came of an old and highly respectable stock
located in the county of Herts., his father being for many years
landlord of &ldquo;The George,&rdquo; at Barnet, a stage on the
Great North road, through which, in the old coaching days, scores
of coaches passed daily.&nbsp; He was a coach proprietor, and
handled the ribbons himself.&nbsp; The son was educated at the
Spalding Grammar School, and acquired antiquarian, tastes while
yet a boy.&nbsp; After having held some important public offices
in that town, and then managing some mills at Aswardby, he bought
the Bull at Horncastle.&nbsp; Though the inn had previously held
a high position, he still further raised its character; and his
spare time was devoted to reading, and research of various
kinds.&nbsp; He had a very valuable collection of coins, the
result of many years of careful selection.&nbsp; His garden, just
out of the town, had an observatory, furnished with telescope,
books, and other appliances for amusement and relaxation.&nbsp;
He supplied the illustrations for a book entitled &ldquo;In
Tennyson Land,&rdquo; by J. Cuming Walters, published in
1890.&nbsp; He was a member of the Architectural Society of
Lincolnshire, Notts. and Leicestershire; a member of the Spalding
Gentlemen&rsquo;s Society, one of the oldest antiquarian
societies in the kingdom; and he was continually corresponding,
in various directions, on subjects of antiquarian interest.&nbsp;
He had a valuable library of books bearing on these and kindred
studies, and indicating the wide extent of his reading.&nbsp;
Especially, perhaps, as a Tennysonian expert, he was consulted by
almost everyone who has written on that subject, as in the case
already named, and in Napier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homes and Haunts of
Tennyson.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a treat to get a quiet, genial hour
with him, when he would run on with a stream of informing
converse, but on few themes did he warm up with so much
inspiration as that of the late Laureate, witness these lines of
his own composition:&mdash;</p>
<h3>SOMERSBY.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Bright Somersby! the sometime summer haunt<br />
Of Norsemen and of Dane, whose bards mayhap<br />
Foretold&mdash;a nest of nightingales would come,<br />
And trill their songs in shades of Holy Well;<br />
Prophetic bards; for we have lived to see<br />
Within your bounds a large-limbed race of men;<br />
A long-lived race, and brimming o&rsquo;er with song,<br />
From lays of ancient Greece, and Roman eld,<br />
To songs of Arthur&rsquo;s knights, and England&rsquo;s prime,<br
/>
And modern verse, in graceful sonnet sung.<br />
<!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Each of the brood was clothed upon with song;<br />
Yet some had stronger pinions than the rest;<br />
And one there was, who for thy fame will long<br />
Send pilgrims to thy cross in loving quest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Caswell passed away in August, 1896, much valued and much
missed by many friends who knew his worth.</p>
<p>A trace of the Saxon still survives in the name of a field, to
the south of the town, and lately given to the town by the Lord
of the Manor, which is called &ldquo;The Wong.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is an old Saxon word for &ldquo;meadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Ancient English Romance of Havelok the Dane&rdquo; (Early
English Text Society, London, 1868), we find in line 397,
&ldquo;Casteles and tunes, wodes and wonges,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
castles and villages, woods and fields.&nbsp; In Stamford a back
street, formerly in the suburbs, retains the name Wong
street.&nbsp; In North Yorkshire is a hamlet named Wet-wang, and
in our own neighbourhood, at Halton Holegate, near Spilsby, there
is land called &ldquo;The Wongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horncastle was the Roman station Banovallum, or fortress on
the Bane, mentioned by the historian Ravennas.&nbsp; Fragments of
the massive walls of the old castrum, or fort, can be distinctly
traced by those who know where to look for them; but they need
looking for, since, for the most part, they are hidden in the
back premises of shops or residences, which face the
street.&nbsp; Briefly stated, the western wall runs along the
western boundary of the churchyard of the Parish Church, and may
there be seen, as well as a fragment of it in a yard at the end
of the road which passes north of the churchyard.&nbsp; It
continued northward to within a few yards of the bridge over the
northern branch of the canal.&nbsp; The southern wall runs almost
parallel with the south branch of the canal, portions being
visible at the back of the Grammar School, and at a corner of St.
Mary&rsquo;s square close to the churchyard.&nbsp; This runs
eastward through various back premises, and may best be seen in a
coalyard near the canal.&nbsp; At that point the eastern wall
begins, and runs northward, passing under some houses, and yards,
and under the High street, the most north-easterly point being
found in a small yard at the back of the shop of Messrs. Carlton
and Sons, Chemists, adjoining Dog Kennel yard; so called because
Lord Fitz-Williams&rsquo; hounds were kennelled there when he
hunted the South Wold country nearly a century ago.&nbsp; The
northern wall runs through <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>back
premises an the north of the Market place, and at the back of Mr.
Overton&rsquo;s and Mr. Lunn&rsquo;s premises.&nbsp; In the
fields on the south-west of the town, and beyond the south branch
of the canal was formerly a maze, such as have been found at
other Roman stations. <a name="citation188a"></a><a
href="#footnote188a" class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; This was
named &ldquo;Julian&rsquo;s Bower,&rdquo; and thought by Stukeley
to be Roman, but the late Bishop Suffragan, E. Trollope, in a
Paper read at Horncastle, June 3rd, 1858, <a
name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a> pronounced it to be
medi&aelig;val.&nbsp; In the Roman maze the youths played at
&ldquo;Tory Town;&rdquo; and as this game was first taught by
Ascanius, called also Iulus, the son of &AElig;neas, from him it
acquired the name &ldquo;Julian.&rdquo; <a
name="citation188c"></a><a href="#footnote188c"
class="citation">[188c]</a>&nbsp; At the west end of the town, in
the angle between the roads leading to the railway station and
Edlington, is a site called Maypole Hill.&nbsp; Here the boys and
girls used to march in procession on May day, bearing flowers,
&ldquo;with wands called May-gads in their hands, enwreathed with
cowslips,&rdquo; and dance around the Maypole; a relic, as some
authorities say, of the Roman Festival of the Floralia; <a
name="citation188d"></a><a href="#footnote188d"
class="citation">[188d]</a> others say it was a practice
introduced by the Danish Vikings, with whom the Maypole, often a
fixture, represented a sacred tree, around which councils were
held and human sacrifices were offered. <a
name="citation188e"></a><a href="#footnote188e"
class="citation">[188e]</a>&nbsp; These games in Horncastle, Mr.
Weir, in his History, <a name="citation188f"></a><a
href="#footnote188f" class="citation">[188f]</a> says, were given
up about 1780.&nbsp; Several Roman roads converge at
Horncastle.&nbsp; The old Roman castle, says Leland, <a
name="citation188g"></a><a href="#footnote188g"
class="citation">[188g]</a> quoting an old mysterious chronicle,
&ldquo;Vortimer caused to be beten doune; and never sin was
re-fortified; the which castel was first enstrengthened by Hors,
Hengist&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; The modern name,
Horncastle, is the Saxon Hyrn-Ceaster, or &ldquo;castle in a
corner,&rdquo; as it is placed in the angle formed by the two
streams, <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>the Bain and the Waring.&nbsp; The
word Hyrn, or Hurn, occurs at other places in the county,
representing an angle or promontory, as well as a recess or
bay.</p>
<p>To come to a later period, it appears, from Domesday Book,
that Horncastle, at one time, had been the property of Editha,
the wife of Edward the Confessor, but at the date of that Survey
it belonged to King William himself.&nbsp; In the reign of
Stephen it was the demesne of Adelias de Cundi, daughter and
heiress of William de Chesney, Lord of Caenby and Glentham.&nbsp;
On her death it reverted to the Crown, and the manor was bestowed
by Henry II. on Gerbald de Escald, a Fleming.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his grandson, Gerard de Rhodes, during whose
minority it was held, in trust, by Ranulph, Earl of
Chester.&nbsp; Gerard was succeeded by his son Ralph de Rhodes,
who, in the reign of Henry III., sold the manor to Walter
Mauclerke, Bishop of Carlisle, and Treasurer of the
Exchequer.&nbsp; This was afterwards confirmed by the King, who
conferred upon the Bishop, by a succession of charters, various
privilege&rsquo;s and immunities, which tended to the growth and
prosperity of the town.&nbsp; Among other powers bestowed upon
the Bishop was the right to seize and try felons, and on the
south-east of the parish there is a place, still called
&ldquo;Hangman&rsquo;s Corner,&rdquo; where criminals were
executed by his order.&nbsp; The bishops long had a palace, their
chief Residence, in Horncastle, which was situated at the rear of
the Black Horse inn and the premises of Mr. Lunn, grocer.&nbsp;
It was demolished in 1770.&nbsp; The manor continued their
property till the reign of Ed. VI., when Bishop Aldrich sold it
to Edward, Lord Clinton, who, however, was compelled by Queen
Mary to re-convey it to the See of Carlisle, and the bishops
continued lords of the manor till 1856, when it was transferred
to the Bishop of Lincoln with the patronage of the
benefice.&nbsp; The lease of this manor was held by Queen
Elizabeth and her successor, James I., who assigned it to Sir
Henry Clinton.&nbsp; This lease was held for nearly a century by
Sir Joseph Banks and his family, ultimately passing to James
Banks Stanhope, Esq., late of Revesby.</p>
<p>Of the Church not a great deal need be said.&nbsp; It was
thoroughly restored in 1864, at a cost of &pound;4,000, and is
now in an excellent condition.&nbsp; The east window is almost a
copy, on an enlarged scale, of the east window of Haltham church,
in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; It exhibits, in stained glass,
events in the life of the Saviour; <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>beneath it
is a carved reredos of Caen stone, the central subject of the
sculpture being the agony in the garden, with figures of the four
Evangelists, two on each side.&nbsp; The organ is a costly and
very fine instrument, mainly due to the liberality of the late
Henry James Fielding.&nbsp; In the north aisle is a brass of Sir
Lionel Dymoke, in armour, kneeling on a cushion; on either side
are two shields, and beneath, figures of two sons and three
daughters.&nbsp; His hands are placed together as in prayer, and
from his left elbow issues a scroll, with the inscription,
&ldquo;Sc&rsquo;ta trinitas unus deus miserere nob.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The shields display the arms of Dymoke, Waterton, Marmyon,
Hebden, and Haydon.&nbsp; The antiquarian, Gervase Holles, gives,
from the Harleian MSS., several other inscriptions, which no
longer exist, but which are found in Weir&rsquo;s &ldquo;History
of Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near this, attached to the wall above
the north-east door, and on each side of the arch between the
aisle and chancel, are some rude weapons of war in the shape of
long knives, or scythes, supposed to have been used at the
Winceby fight, when it is known that the troops of the Royalists
were very badly armed. <a name="citation190"></a><a
href="#footnote190" class="citation">[190]</a>&nbsp; There are
several memorial tablets on the walls.&nbsp; In the floor of the
south aisle, towards the east end, is the tombstone of Sarah
Sellwood, wife of Henry Sellwood, Esq., and mother-in-law of Lord
Tennyson, the Poet Laureate.&nbsp; She died Sept. 30th,
1816.&nbsp; The roof is of Spanish chestnut, which was formerly
completely hidden by a flat plaster ceiling.&nbsp; On the north
wall of the chancel, over the north-east door, is a tablet to the
memory of Sir Ingram Hopton, who, after unhorsing Cromwell, was
himself slain at the battle of Winceby, the date of which is
there wrongly given as &ldquo;October 6th, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1643,&rdquo; whereas the fight really
took place on October 11th.&nbsp; Cromwell is also there
designated as &ldquo;the arch rebel,&rdquo; whereas at that time
he was <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>only a colonel; but, to quote two
words from the Latin inscription, he was then an instance of
&ldquo;celata virtus,&rdquo; his future greatness not yet known;
and the epitaph, of course inscribed afterwards, is a slight
solecism, and we may here venture to make the remark that this
monument is now itself a further instance of &ldquo;celata
virtus,&rdquo; for it is placed in a position where no light
falls upon it, and the writer actually looked at it recently
without recognising what it was.&nbsp; On the wall between nave
and chancel, on the south side, is a small stone bearing the
names of Thomas Gibson, Vicar; John Hamerton and John Goake,
Church-wardens, 1675.&nbsp; Walker, in his &ldquo;Sufferings of
the Clergy&rdquo; (1714), gives an account of this Vicar, which
is here abridged.&nbsp; Born at Keswick, educated at
Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, he was appointed Master of the
Free School at Carlisle; thence to that of Newcastle, and
preferred by the Bishop of Carlisle to the Vicarage in
1634.&nbsp; In consequence of a sermon preached by him, at the
election for convocation, he was seized, in 1643, and carried as
a prisoner to Hull.&nbsp; Being released, after four
months&rsquo; detention, and returning to Horncastle, he was
charged with teaching &ldquo;Ormanism&rdquo; (Arminianism), and
committed to the &ldquo;county jayl&rdquo; at Lincoln, and a
Presbyterian minister appointed in his stead at Horncastle.&nbsp;
In 1644, Colonel King, the governor of Boston, ordered a party of
horse to seize him (he apparently having been released from
Lincoln) and to plunder his house, but an old pupil,
Lieut.-Colonel John Lillburn, interceded for him with his
superior officer, Col. King, and the order was revoked; on
Lillburn, however, presently going to London, the order was
repeated, and Mr. Gibson was made prisoner, his house plundered,
and his saddle horse, draught horses, and oxen, taken from
him.&nbsp; He was imprisoned at Boston, then in Lincoln, and in
&ldquo;Tattors-Hall-Castle, where he had very ill usage for 17
weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sequestered from his living, and an
&ldquo;intruder,&rdquo; one Obadiah How, put in charge.&nbsp; He
was now accused by the Puritans of obeying the orders of the
Church, defending episcopacy, refusing &ldquo;the
covenant,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; He retired &ldquo;to a mean
house,&rdquo; about a mile from Horncastle (supposed to be at
Nether (Low) Toynton), where he and his family &ldquo;lived but
poorly for two years, teaching a few pupils.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
then made master of the free school at Newark; two years later
removed to the school at Sleaford, being presented by Lady
Carr.&nbsp; <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>There he lived until the
Restoration, and then resumed his Vicarage at Horncastle, until
he died, in 1674, aged 84.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a grave and
Venerable Person, of a Sober and Regular conversation, and so
studious of peace, that when any Differences arose in his Parish,
he never rested till he had Composed them.&nbsp; He had likewise
so well Principled his Parish, that of 250 families in it, he
left but one of them Dissenters at his Death.&rdquo; <a
name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a>&nbsp; There is an inscription painted
on the south wall of the chancel, with gilt and coloured border,
commemorative of this worthy Vicar, which truly states that he
&ldquo;lived in times when truth to the Church and loyalty to the
King met with punishment due only to the worst of
crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church of St. Mary is not named in
Domesday Book, and probably at that time no church existed on
this site.&nbsp; But in the Record of an Inquisition post mortem,
taken at Horncastle, Jan. 21st, 1384&ndash;5, Richard II., it is
stated that the King gave to a certain Gilbert, Prior of
Wyllesforth, and his successors, two messuages, &amp;c., and the
site of the Chapel of St. Lawrence, with appurtenances, in
Horncastre, on condition that &ldquo;they find a fit chaplain to
celebrate mass in the chapel aforesaid, three days in every
week.&rdquo; <a name="citation192b"></a><a href="#footnote192b"
class="citation">[192b]</a>&nbsp; This chapel probably stood in
or near the street running northward out of the Market place, and
called St. Lawrence street, near which bodies have been exhumed
at different times.&nbsp; When the clump of shops were cleared
away in 1892, to make the present Market place, through the
liberality of the late Right Hon. Edward Stanhope, several large
fragments of Norman pillars were found, which probably once
belonged to the old Norman chapel. <a name="citation193c"></a><a
href="#footnote193c" class="citation">[193c]</a>&nbsp; St.
Lawrence is the Patron Saint of Horncastle; and as he was
martyred on a brander, or gridiron, the arms of the town are a
Gridiron.&nbsp; The &ldquo;canting&rdquo; device of a castle on a
horn has no very ancient authority.&nbsp; The &ldquo;pancake
bell&rdquo; is rung on Shrove Tuesday, at 10 a.m.; the Curfew at
8 p.m. from Oct. 11 to April 6, except Saturdays at 7 p.m., and
omitting from St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day to Plough Monday.&nbsp; The
Grammar School bell used to be rung, and the writer has often
assisted, as a boy, in ringing it at 7 a.m.; but it has been
given up of late years, <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>as the
governors of the school declined to pay far it.</p>
<p>In one of the Parish Registers appears the following
entry:&mdash;&ldquo;On the Vth daie of October one thousand six
hundred &amp; three, in the first yeare of our Souvraine Lord
King James was holden in Horncastle Church a solemn fast from
eight in the morning until foure a clock in the afternoone by
five preachers, vidiz. Mr. Hollinhedge, vicar of Horncastle, Mr.
Turner of Edlington, Mr. Downe of Lusbye, Mr. Phillipe of
Salmonbye, Mr. Tanzey of Hagworthingha&rsquo;, occasioned by a
general and most feareful plague yt yeare in sundrie places of
this land, but especially upon the cytie of London.&nbsp; Pr. me
Clementen Whitelock.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Record at the Rolls Court
states that Horncastle Church was resorted to by a robber for the
purpose of Sanctuary, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;22 August
1229.&nbsp; The King (at Windsor) commands the Sheriff of
Lincolnshire (Radulphus filius Reginald) to send two coroners of
the county to see that a robber who keeps himself in the Church
of Horncastle, abjures the kingdom.&rdquo; <a
name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a>&nbsp; Among some MS. Records in the
possession of Mr. John Overton, I find it stated that in
December, 1812, the vestry room was broken open and robbed of all
the money, and other valuables; and that &pound;50 reward was
offered by the Vestry for the discovery of the culprits.</p>
<p>Although the Manor of Horncastle was at more than one period
Royal property, it has only once, so far as we know, been visited
by Royalty.&nbsp; Leland states that &ldquo;in the year of our
Lord 1406, on the 12th of September, on <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Saturday at
6 o&rsquo;clock, Henry (IV.) by the grace of God, King of
England, came from the town of Horncastle, to the Abbey of
Bardney, with a great and honourable company on horseback&rdquo;;
and that &ldquo;the Abbot and Convent of the aforesaid Monastery
went out to meet him in procession at the outer gates.&rdquo; <a
name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; We have no further known record
of this visit; but as Henry IV. was the son of John of Gaunt, and
born at Bolingbroke, we may assume that he passed through
Horncastle on his way from Bolingbroke to the palace of his
father at Lincoln, and that John of Gaunt&rsquo;s stables, still
standing at the present day in the High street of that city,
sheltered the steeds of the company at the end of their
journey.&nbsp; Doubtless he adjourned a night, if not more, at
Horncastle, and the loyal old town, probably headed by the
Champion Dymoke of the day, would give him as hearty a welcome as
that which awaited him from the abbot and monks at Bardney.</p>
<p>Two or three more short remarks may be made about
Horncastle.&nbsp; When Sir Ingram Hopton, whose tablet we have
mentioned as being in the church, was slain at Winceby, the body,
by Cromwell&rsquo;s order, was brought to Horncastle for
burial.&nbsp; It was placed in the house, or, rather, a previous
house on the same site, in West Street, now named Cromwell House;
and it is said, on what authority we do not know, that Cromwell
himself came to Horncastle, that he might personally instruct the
churchwarden, Mr. Hamerton, that the opponent, whom he pronounced
to be &ldquo;a brave gentleman,&rdquo; should be properly
honoured in his obsequies. <a name="citation194b"></a><a
href="#footnote194b" class="citation">[194b]</a></p>
<p>A house at the south-west corner of the market place, where
Mr. R. W. Clitherow, solicitor, now lives, was formerly a
public-house, but was burnt down and the present one
erected.&nbsp; At this house, then occupied by Mr. Sellwood,
solicitor, Sir John Franklin visited, and was entertained at a
public dinner, a few days before <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>he set out,
in 1844, on his final Arctic expedition; and the writer remembers
his father going to attend this dinner.</p>
<p>We have said that, 100 years ago, almost every house was
thatched.&nbsp; A record in Mr. Overton&rsquo;s possession states
that the two first slate-roofed houses in the town were one built
by Mr. Storr, a gardener, afterwards occupied by Mrs.
L&rsquo;Oste, widow of the Rev. C. L&rsquo;Oste, rector of
Langton, and now occupied by Dr. Howes; and the house of Mr.
Titus Overton, now occupied by Mr. John Overton, being erected in
1793.</p>
<p>Having completed our perambulations of the town, let us betake
ourselves once more to the country.&nbsp; We remount the hill,
which we descended on leaving Thimbleby for Horncastle, but by a
different road, viz., one running due west.&nbsp; Half way up the
ascent of this, the westernmost spur of the chalky Wolds, we have
two roads, either of which would bring us to Woodhall Spa, almost
equi-distant by either; but that is not, as yet, our
destination.&nbsp; We continue the ascent, due westward.&nbsp;
The summit reached, we have a wide prospect before us.&nbsp; To
the left, on a clear day, Boston Stump is visible, the Tower on
the Moor rises above the woods, beyond that Tattershall castle
and church; in the dim distance the graceful spire of Heckington
points, like a needle, to the sky.&nbsp; Straight in front of us
woods on woods band and bar the prospect, relieved by the spires
of Old Woodhall and Horsington.&nbsp; To the right, the horizon
is crowned by the almost pyramidal shape of Lincoln Minster, the
seeing eye also detecting the lesser pyramid of the Chapter
House, other spires, with the factory chimneys of the now busy
city, more than its old prosperity being revived.&nbsp; Further
to the right the plantations of Fillingham Castle, some miles
beyond Lincoln, on the &ldquo;Spital road,&rdquo; fringe the
view.&nbsp; Truly, it is a wide-ranging outlook, embracing little
short of 30 miles, with many a village and hamlet, buried and
unseen, in its entourage of wood.&nbsp; Immediately in the near
front is Langton mill, a conspicuous object, which I have
distinguished from the top of Lincoln Minster itself.&nbsp;
Half-a-mile farther lies the village of Langton, one of three of
the same name in the neighbourhood&mdash;one near Spilsby, one
near Wragby, and this &ldquo;by Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to
the meaning of the name Langton, Dr. Oliver refers the first
syllable to the British &ldquo;Lan&rdquo; (Welsh Llan), meaning
&ldquo;place of worship,&rdquo; and so corresponding to Kirkby,
or <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Kirkstead.&nbsp; In this particular case, however, the
ordinary meaning of &ldquo;Lang,&rdquo; or &ldquo;long,&rdquo;
would be specially applicable, since the village has evidently at
one time been larger than at present, and the parish extended,
some six miles, to the Witham, until, quite recently, the distant
portion was included in Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; Here again we had,
until recent years, in the rectory, another moated residence,
standing almost on an island, being surrounded by water except
for the space of the churchyard and the width of a drive to the
house.&nbsp; The moat was drained for sanitary reasons about 50
yeans ago, to the regret of many, since, as has been mentioned in
a previous chapter (Chapter VI.), it contained an abundance of
large pike, and other fish, from which the lake at Sturton Hall
was stocked.&nbsp; The Queen was the lady of the manor until, in
1860, much Crown property was sold in this neighbourhood, and the
manor and most of the land in the parish, except the glebe, was
bought by the Coates family, who have a substantial residence
here.</p>
<p>In three fields at the west end of the village are traces of
ponds, mounds, and hollows, indicating large buildings existing
at one time.&nbsp; And we have sundry records of men of rank who
have owned land, and probably resided, in the parish.&nbsp;
Dugdale <a name="citation196a"></a><a href="#footnote196a"
class="citation">[196a]</a> tells us that this &ldquo;town&rdquo;
was given by the Conqueror to the then powerful Bishop of Durham,
whose name was William de Karilepho.&nbsp; He was Chief Justice
of England.&nbsp; This gift the Conqueror may be said to have
&ldquo;confirmed with an oath,&rdquo; for the charter, conveying
the land, sets forth that they &ldquo;shall be preserved
inviolable for ever,&rdquo; and concludes with an anathema on
whosoever shall profane the charter, or change anything therein,
unless for the better:&mdash;&ldquo;by the authority of the
Prince of Apostles, I deprive them of the society of the Lord,
the aforesaid Pope Gregory, and the Church; and reserve them by
the judgment of God, to be punished by everlasting fire with the
devil and his angels.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; This fearful
threat of Divine vengeance, however, seems to have lost its
terror after a lapse of time of no very great length, since,
according to the historian Banks, <a name="citation196b"></a><a
href="#footnote196b" class="citation">[196b]</a> in the 9th year
of Edward I. Philip de Marmion held the manor.</p>
<p>There was formerly not only Langton, but an outlying
Langton-thorpe, and this is probably <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>referred to
in Domesday Book as the &ldquo;Berewick&rdquo; of Langton, for it
is there stated that Robert Dispenser held in this Berewick <a
name="citation197a"></a><a href="#footnote197a"
class="citation">[197a]</a> of Langton one carucate in demesne,
eight soke men (tenants) with half a carucate, and four villeins
with two carucates, and twenty-four acres of meadow, and two
hundred and eighty acres of wood containing pasturage.</p>
<p>A powerful family of the Angevines lived here at a later
period.&nbsp; There is, extant among the Records of Lincoln, <a
name="citation197b"></a><a href="#footnote197b"
class="citation">[197b]</a> the Will of Robert Angevine, Gent.,
of Langton by Horncastle, dated 25th April, 1545, in which he
requests that he may be buried in the church of St. Margaret; he
bequeaths to his daughters, Millesancte, Grace, Jane, and Mary,
&ldquo;vli. apiece,&rdquo; the money to come out of Burnsall,
Hebden, Conyseat, and Norton, in Yorkshire; to his wife Margaret
&ldquo;xli. a year for life out of the said lands&rdquo;; and to
his son William lands in Hameringham.&nbsp; The family acquired
their name thus:&mdash;Ivo Tailbois was at the head of the
Aungevine troops of auxiliaries which William the Conqueror
brought over with him from Normandy; and this name, in time, took
the various forms of Aungelyne, Aungeby, and Angevine.&nbsp;
There were Angevines at Whaplode, in the south-east of the
county, in the 12th century.&nbsp; There was a branch of them at
Theddlethorpe, and at Saltfleetby, in the 14th century.&nbsp; The
one at Langton had a brother at West Ashby.&nbsp; They appear in
the Visitation of 1562 among the leading families of the county
gentry; but in 1592 the name does not appear, and they dwindled
away, and at the time of the Commonwealth are nowhere
found.&nbsp; The old families of Scroope and of Langton are also
said to have resided here.&nbsp; A member of the family of the
Dightons, who owned Stourton, Waddingworth, and other properties
in this neighbourhood, if not actually residing in Langton
(although he probably did), had an interest in the place, as, in
a Will, still at Lincoln, dated 15th July, 1557, having requested
that he might &ldquo;be buried in the quire where <!-- page
198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>I
die&rdquo;; among other bequests, he leaves a sum of money
&ldquo;to the poore of Langton by Horncastle.&rdquo; <a

<p>From 1653 to 1656 Justice Filkin resided at Langton, and
before him persons of Horncastle and the neighbourhood were
frequently married, the law at that time recognising only civil
marriages.</p>
<p>The church of Langton (St. Margaret&rsquo;s) is a small
edifice, and, until recently, was in a very poor condition, with
no pretension to architectural beauty in any of its
features.&nbsp; It had been rebuilt in the 18th century, at the
very worst period for such work, and so badly done that it was
almost a ruin when the writer, as rector, undertook its
restoration.&nbsp; Though still small, it now has several
interesting features.&nbsp; The pulpit, reading desk and lectern
have been carved by the Rector, in old oak, in Jacobean style, in
memory of his father, who was rector 49 years.&nbsp; In the
chancel there is an Aumbrey containing an ancient stoup of
Barnack stone, said to have formerly been the holy water vessel
of Spalding Priory.&nbsp; On the Communion table is a curious old
alms dish of &ldquo;lateen&rdquo; metal; the device in the centre
is the temptation by the devil of our first parents; an
inscription in old Dutch runs round,&mdash;Vreest Goedt
honderhovedt syn geboedt; or, Fear God, keep his
commandments.&nbsp; The font bowl is Early Norman, of Barnack
stone, discovered by the Rector among rubbish in some back
premises in Horncastle, and supposed to have been the font of the
Early Norman church of St. Lawrence, once existing there; the
pedestal and base are fragments from the ruins of
Kirkstead.&nbsp; In a recess, or aumbrey, behind the west door,
is a very interesting relic, found, a few years ago, in the moat
of the old hall at Poolham, which we described in the previous
chapter.&nbsp; We there mentioned the remains of an oratory, or
chapel, still standing in the south-west corner of the kitchen
garden at the old Hall.&nbsp; Some men were employed in cleaning
out the mud from the encircling moat, the season being a very dry
one, and the moat almost empty of water.&nbsp; This had not been
done for many years, if ever before, and the mud was some feet
thick.&nbsp; Below the above-named chapel ruins an object was
thrown up among the mud, which the men took to be a broken seed
vessel formerly <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>belonging to a birdcage, but as it
was curiously marked, one of them took it home, and asked the
writer to go and look at it.&nbsp; He did so, and, seeing its
antiquity, he obtained it for a trifle, and communicated with the
Society of Antiquaries, and other authorities, about it, with the
result that it was pronounced to be a medi&aelig;val
chrismatory.&nbsp; It was made of coarse tarra-cotta of a greyish
buff colour, ornamented with patterns of squares, diamonds and
crosses, with a fleur-de-lys in the centre of one side,
emblematic of the Trinity.&nbsp; It contained in the body two
square wells about an inch deep, which were originally covered
with arched roofs, but one of these had been broken off.&nbsp; At
each end was a spout from the cellar.&nbsp; Its total length was
7 inches; its height, including the roof, 4 inches; breadth, 3
inches.&nbsp; The use of the chrismatory was this:&mdash;When a
child was to be baptised, as it was brought into the church it
was sprinkled with salt, and at baptism it was anointed with oil;
and the two cellars were intended respectively to hold the salt
and oil.&nbsp; This object has been exhibited on various public
occasions, and has excited much interest, as it is considered to
be quite unique.&nbsp; The church was at one time considerably
larger, as, at the restoration in 1891, the foundations of a
north aisle were found, as well as of a tower.&nbsp; The Land
Revenue Records mention that, in 1553, it had &ldquo;three gret
bells and a sanctum bell.&rdquo; <a name="citation199a"></a><a
href="#footnote199a" class="citation">[199a]</a>&nbsp; The only
remaining bell bears the inscription &ldquo;Anno Domini 1579, R.
G.&rdquo; <a name="citation199b"></a><a href="#footnote199b"
class="citation">[199b]</a>&nbsp; Considerable neglect has been
allowed in the past, as is shown by the Archdeacon&rsquo;s
Visitation in 1606, when the rector, Wm. Kirk, was presented
&ldquo;for the decay of his parsonage house&rdquo;; while Wm.
Newport, Thos. Goniston, and John Hodgson, guardians, were
reported as &ldquo;collecting monie to ye value of iijl, vjs,
vijd, to buy a Co&rsquo;ion Cup, and not p&rsquo;viding one, and
for not p&rsquo;viding a sufficient bible, and a chest with two
lockers and keys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Uriah Kirke, rector, was also
presented &ldquo;for suffering a barne of 3 baies to fall down
belonging to ye parsonage, and for his chauncel being in decay,
and the chauncel windows all broken.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Charles
Johnson and Augnes, widow of Robt. Thurnhill, late guardian, were
reported as &ldquo;selling away ye Communion Cup belonging to ye
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; This larger church had several windows in
the chancel, instead of the one window of the modern church, and
an old <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>document thus describes them and
their colouring:&mdash;</p>

<p>These windows were evidently fine, and indicate a connection
with the parish of the ancient families Everingham, Skipwith,
Deseyrt, Bec and Willoughby. <a name="citation200a"></a><a
href="#footnote200a" class="citation">[200a]</a>&nbsp; The
architect for the restoration was Mr. W. Scorer, of Lincoln; and
the roof of nave and chancel was painted in panels, with emblems
of the Passion, and texts, by Mr. Powell, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The
patronage of the living was vested in Mr. Willoughby West, who
also founded and endowed a couple of Bede houses, but the family
is now extinct, and by lapse the patronage is with the
Bishop.</p>
<p>A walk of a mile farther through fields, one of which is known
as Dog-fight, another Broad moor, and a third Pry-close, brings
us to the church (St. Margaret also) of Old Woodhall.&nbsp; The
name of this field &ldquo;Pry-close&rdquo; would seem to be an
interesting Norman survival; &ldquo;Pre&rdquo; is a meadow.&nbsp;
Near Northampton are &ldquo;the verdant meads of De la
Pr&egrave;.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this may have been the home pasture
of the old Wood-Hall.&nbsp; Praie, however, is an old word
meaning coarse grass, which is still to be seen in the
field.&nbsp; This church again, of which the writer is vicar, was
in a dangerous condition when he entered on the benefice in 1890,
but was restored in 1893.&nbsp; It possessed an interesting
feature in the spire, one, according to an old saying, of the
only four spires existing on this, the eastern, side of the river
Witham; that of Louth being the chief, and one of the finest in
the kingdom, which took 15 years in building; that of South
Somercotes being a third; and that of Linwood being a fourth, of
which Gough, in his additions to Camden&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; (vol. ii., p. 267), says it &ldquo;is
the only one to be seen in a round of 59 parishes
hereabouts.&rdquo; <a name="citation200b"></a><a
href="#footnote200b" class="citation">[200b]</a>&nbsp; The spire
of <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>Woodhall is a modest imitation of that of Louth, having
flying buttresses.&nbsp; Half-way up it is encircled by a
battlemented corona.&nbsp; Its structure is peculiar, as it rests
entirely and solely on two buttresses on each side of the west
door.&nbsp; It dates from the 14th century.&nbsp; The body of the
church is modern, being rebuilt in the worst style in 1807,
partly of brick and partly of stone, the roof throughout being of
one elevation, without any distinction between nave and
chancel.&nbsp; At the restoration, the Vicar, as at Langton,
carved the pulpit, reading-desk, font cover, and desk for
Communion table, in memory of his father, who was 50 years
vicar.&nbsp; The font was formerly in the little chapel, or
oratory, in the garden at Poolham Hall, previously referred to,
and left there neglected.&nbsp; It is here restored to its
original sacred purpose, and is supported by four handsome
columns of serpentine, from the Lizard quarries, Cornwall, the
gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, vicar of Wispington.&nbsp; The
church has two bells.&nbsp; Further details of Woodhall were
given in a previous chapter, in describing the old moated
Wood-Hall.&nbsp; It was at the farm close by the church that a
well (also previously mentioned) was sunk to a depth of 33 feet,
which tapped a saline spring, resembling, it was said, the
Woodhall Spa water, but which soon lost its salt taste from the
inrush of fresh water. <a name="citation201"></a><a
href="#footnote201" class="citation">[201]</a>&nbsp; Beside a
pond just outside the churchyard there is a very large ice-borne
boulder, measuring about 4&frac12; feet in length, 4 feet in
width, and 1&frac12; feet in thickness.</p>
<p>In an old charter &ldquo;dated at Edlington on Wednesday next
after the feast of St. Michael, 1285,&rdquo; by which William,
son of William de Wvspington, grants to William Hardigrey of
Edlington, clerk, certain properties, one of the witnesses is
Aluered de Wodhalle, along with several others.&nbsp; This would
probably be a descendant of Alured of Lincoln, who, in Domesday
Book, is said to be possessed of 51 lordships in Lincolnshire,
besides property in other counties.&nbsp; The last descendant
died without male issue, 48 Henry III., leaving his three sisters
his next heirs, and so the name perished.</p>
<p>We now retrace our steps as far as Langton mill, and there
taking the road which branches off to the right, southward, we
soon arrive at Thornton.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to St.
Wilfrid (Archbishop <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 709), which
replaced <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>a mean structure, built about 1730
in the worst of styles, with flat plaster ceiling and wooden
window frames with large square panes of glass, was entirely
rebuilt in the Perpendicular style, and thoroughly well done, in
1889&ndash;90, by Canon J. Clare Hudson, vicar, and the leading
parishioners, at a cost of &pound;1,000.&nbsp; The only objects
of any antiquarian interest are some quaint wrought-iron double
crosses affixed to the north and south walls of the nave, having
eight iron hat pegs on each.&nbsp; The font is modern, its bowl
octagonal, with the monogram I.H.S. and other devices on
alternate sides.&nbsp; In the chancel are modern frescoes
executed by Miss Alice Erskine, an amateur artist of much
taste.&nbsp; The subject on the north wall is the visit of the
Magi to the Infant Saviour, while on the wall to the south of the
east window are representatives of the Archangels St. Michael and
St. Gabriel.&nbsp; Gifts of handsome brass candlesticks for the
Holy Table, and service books have recently been made by H. R.
Elmhirst, Esq., and Mrs. Elmhirst.&nbsp; The Communion table is
of Indian teakwood.&nbsp; We may here observe that the Records at
Lincoln shew that there were rectors in this parish (though now a
vicarage) in 1232 and downwards, and a list of the incumbents
from that date to the present time has been compiled by Canon
Hudson, and may be seen in the parish chest.&nbsp; The Parish
Registers date from 1561.&nbsp; Among the gentry mentioned in the
Registers as residents in the parish are several members of the
very old county family of Maddison, who intermarried with the
Dymokes.&nbsp; In digging in the churchyard on the north-west of
the old church, the base of the west tower of the pre-Reformation
church was found, which was said also to have had two
aisles.&nbsp; In the churchyard is a tombstone commemorative of
Penelope Gunnis, who died in 1826, at the advanced age of 107
years.&nbsp; The western portions of this parish, which stretches
from within 150 yards of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Horncastle, to
within 100 yards of the Witham at Kirkstead wharf, are now
included in the Civil parish of Woodhall Spa.</p>
<p>In the reign of the Conqueror the powerful Robert Despenser
had in this parish eighty acres of meadow land, three hundred and
fifty acres of wood, and two mills, with sokemen, velleins, and
bordars; other land, with dependents, being owned by Gozelin, a
vassal of Alured of Lincoln, named above in connection <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>with Woodhall.&nbsp; The Champion Dymoke is lord of the
manor in the present day.&nbsp; A Roman urn, as has been stated
elsewhere, was dug up in this parish when the railway was being
constructed.&nbsp; The only public notice in connection with
Thornton of an unusual character, in modern times, is the
following, which appeared as an advertisement in the
&ldquo;Stamford Mercury&rdquo; of January 5th, 1810:&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Sacrilege</span>.&mdash;Whereas the Parish Church
of Thornton, near Horncastle, has been lately broken open and a
thin silver half-pint cup stolen out of the chest, any person
giving information of the offender or offenders, shall, on
conviction, receive from the parishioners of Thornton five
guineas reward, and if there was an accomplice in the above
sacrilege who will turn King&rsquo;s evidence, he shall, on
conviction, have the above reward, and every endeavour will be
used to obtain his Majesty&rsquo;s pardon.&mdash;&ldquo;Lincs. N.
&amp; Q.,&rdquo; Oct., 1896.</p>
<p>In a list of gentry who furnished &ldquo;launces and light
horse&rdquo; for the defence of the country in 1584, given in the
Melbourn Hall MS., we find the name of Edward Dymmock, of
Thornton, Gent., put down for &ldquo;j light horse&rdquo; for the
master at Horncastle, and among those who were summoned for the
Sessions there, according to another list, we again find Edward
Dymmock of Thornton, Gent. (&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo;
vol. xxii., pt. ii., pp. 214 and 221).&nbsp; In a grass field, on
the south side of the road through Thornton, there are mounds and
hollows, indicating a large residence, which this Dymmock
probably occupied.</p>
<p>Proceeding three quarters of a mile further southward, and
passing Martin Hall, we turn up a lane to the right and find the
church of Martin, St. Michael&rsquo;s, in a secluded spot, like
many a flower born to blush unseen.&nbsp; Yet it is worthy of a
visit, having features of more than ordinary interest, which were
well preserved on its partial restoration in 1869, and again by
the late W. J. Gilliatt, of the Hall, and his sisters, in
1877.&nbsp; For many years it was a thatched edifice, but now has
a slated roof.&nbsp; The south doorway is Early Norman, with
broad, receding semi-circular arch, with a double band of zigzag
moulding; on each side, Norman columns, with, quaint heads as
capitals.&nbsp; The church is entered by two descending
steps.&nbsp; The font is modern, Norman in style, the bowl having
eight semi-circular fluttings, being supported by eight columns
raised on a stone pediment.&nbsp; The west <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>window is
filled with good modern glass from Munich.&nbsp; The central
subject is the Saviour&rsquo;s body being taken down from the
Cross; the left subject is the Saviour bearing His Cross; the
right, the body being borne away.&nbsp; This was a memorial,
placed in the church by Miss Spalding, of Lincoln, commemorative
of the Rev. J. B. Smith, D.D., the rector, who, in returning from
paying her a visit at Lincoln, fell out of his railway carriage
at Kirkstead and broke his neck, although, strange to say, he
lived for several weeks afterwards. <a name="citation204"></a><a
href="#footnote204" class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; In the north
wall of the nave is a plain arched Easter sepulchre, which was
probably the founder&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; The pulpit is of Caen
stone, plain, and massive; behind it is a curious semi-circular
recess, in the east wall.&nbsp; The chancel arch is Early
English, and very narrow, only 3ft. 9in. in width, which makes
the chancel very dark, an effect further increased by the great
thickness, 3ft. 4in., of the chancel arch wall.&nbsp; The east
window has two trefoiled lights, small and narrow, their total
width only 2ft. 3in.&nbsp; In the south wall of the chancel are
two deeply-recessed small square-headed windows, partly built up,
and having a stone seat at the base, but too high for use.&nbsp;
There are several flat tombstones of Hughsons and Oldhams in the
floor.&nbsp; The Early Norman doorway and the massive chancel
arch wall and gloomy chancel are the special features of this
interesting little church.&nbsp; At the time of the restoration,
in 1877, the original large altar slab, decorated with four
crosses, was found in the floor, face downwards.&nbsp; It was
taken, up, and now forms the base, or d&auml;is, of the Communion
table.&nbsp; The Parish Register commences with 1562.&nbsp; Under
the year 1649 occurs this entry:&mdash;&ldquo;This yeare ye
lordship of Marton was inclosed; no consent of Bishop or
Rector.&rdquo;&nbsp; The unusual name, &ldquo;Ingelo,&rdquo;
specially known in connection with the poem, &ldquo;The Bells of
Enderby,&rdquo; occurs frequently in the Registers from 1673
downwards.&nbsp; <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>The names of Norreys Fynes, and
other members of the family, resident at White-Hall, in this
parish, occur frequently.&nbsp; There is an engraving of the
church in the &ldquo;Church of England Magazine&rdquo; for
1849.&nbsp; We must not omit to mention that the fine fragment of
brickwork called the &ldquo;Tower on the Moor,&rdquo; and co-eval
with Tattershall Castle, although now included in the Civil
parish of Woodhall Spa, stands in what was part of Martin parish
till 1897.&nbsp; There only remains the staircase of what was
once a much larger structure.&nbsp; Leland says, &ldquo;One of
the Cromwelles builded a preaty turret caullid the Tour of the
Moore: and thereby he made a faire greate pond or lake brickid
about.&nbsp; The lake is commonly called the Synkker&rdquo;
(Itinerarium, vol. iv., p. 58).</p>
<p>Scott, the celebrated commentator, began his ministerial
labours in this parish.</p>
<p>In early times.&nbsp; Martin was in the &ldquo;soke&rdquo; of
Kirkby-on-Bain, i.e., it was under the jurisdiction of the lord
of the manor of Kirkby, who, in the time of the Conqueror, was
Eudo, son of Spirewick, the founder <a name="citation205a"></a><a
href="#footnote205a" class="citation">[205a]</a> of the
Tateshall, or Tattershall, family in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; This
Eudo, as Dugdale relates, <a name="citation205b"></a><a
href="#footnote205b" class="citation">[205b]</a> with his sworn
brother in arms, Pinso (though no blood relation), came into
England with the Conqueror, and the two merited so well of him in
that service that they obtained for recompense the lordship of
Tattershall, with the hamlet of Thorpe, and town of Kirkby.&nbsp;
He held direct from the king certain lands in Martin; and as the
Clintons, shortly after the extinction of the Tattershall family,
received their estates, this would be the way in which the
Whitehall estate in Martin came to the Clintons.</p>
<p>Journeying on still southward, some mile and a half from
Martin, we reach the parish of Roughton.&nbsp; The church has no
pretensions to architectural beauty, being a mixture of brick and
sandstone.&nbsp; It has nave, chancel, and castellated tower, and
small castellated parapets at the north and south ends of the
chancel wall; a large west door, and small priests&rsquo; door in
the chancel.&nbsp; It was newly roofed and fitted with open oak
benches in 1870, the chancel being then also paved with encaustic
tiles, the tower opened to the nave, and most of the windows
partly filled with stained glass.&nbsp; The font is plain,
circular, upon a circular pediment; it has <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>an old font
cover, cupola shaped, octagonal, of oak, plain, except some
slight carving round the rim.&nbsp; There are some fragmentary
remains of a carved rood screen, and a plain old oak
pulpit.&nbsp; In the chancel is a lengthy inscription,
commemorative of Norreys Fynes, Esq., which has already been
given to a previous chapter in connection with Fynes of
Whitehall.&nbsp; There is also a mural tablet to the memory of
the Rev. Arthur Rockliffe, who died in 1798; and another to
Charles Pilkington, Esq., who died in 1798, and Abigail his wife,
who died in 1817.&nbsp; The register dates from 1564, and is
therefore a fairly good one, since parochial registers were only
first enjoined in the reign of Henry VIII.,
1530&ndash;1538.&nbsp; The registers contain some peculiar
entries, and exhibit a remarkable orthography, if such a term can
be applied to what would more correctly be called
orthography.&nbsp; Of these entries one is as follows:&mdash;The
churchyard fence was repaired by lengths in 1760, each
parishioner (of any substance) taking a length; a list of their
names is given, closing with the words &ldquo;a piece to the
Lord,&rdquo; i.e., the lord of the manor.&nbsp; In the year
1631&ndash;2 there were 43 burials; among them the rector,
Randulph Woodinge, on Oct. 23nd; his daughter Ann, Oct. 23rd; and
daughter Thomasine, Nov. 1st.&nbsp; There were two of the family
of Carrot, two Lincolns, two Applebys, two Grogbys, three
Hawards, two Burches, besides other single cases.&nbsp; Though it
is not so specified, this would doubtless be the epidemic called
&ldquo;the Plague,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Black Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An entry on &ldquo;Aprill the 15 1707&rdquo; gives &ldquo;The
Church More lying in Well sick cloase was leten for 4 &amp;
6.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is moorland near Well Syke wood belonging to
the church, from which peat was cut for church fuel; and two
other entries refer to this practice: &ldquo;Simon Grant of
Dalderby for 1 days work of bages (i.e., sods) . . . 2 ,,
6.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Simon flinte for 1 days works of bages . .
. 2 &bdquo; 6.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was good pay according to the
rate of wages in the early part of the 18th century, to which
these entries refer.&nbsp; But it was &ldquo;skilled&rdquo;
labour, and, moreover, hard work, as anyone will understand who
remembers the instrument used on the moor forty years ago.&nbsp;
It was a large, flat, and broad kind of shovel at the end of a
long pole with transverse handle a foot long, which was placed
against the workman&rsquo;s waist or pit of his stomach, and he
thus thrust the tool forward through the turf with the whole
weight and <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>force of his body.&nbsp; Those who
were much engaged in this kind of work usually suffered from
rupture of the lower muscles of the body.</p>
<p>For some years before 1657 none but civil marriages were valid
in law, and Justice Filkin is mentioned in the Register as
marrying the Rector of Roughton, John Bancroft, to Ann
Coulen.&nbsp; Persons were often married in the church, as well
as before the Justice; the civil marriage was also often
neglected, and the feeling was generally so strong that marriage
should be a religious rite, that in the year 1657 marriage by the
minister was allowed by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>A peculiar entry in the parish account book is &ldquo;Mary
Would overseer of ye poore gave up hir accountes&rdquo; (1707 Ap.
15).&nbsp; We are now, at the beginning of the 20th century,
admitting women to a limited number of public offices, yet the
people of Roughton were evidently in advance of the times, and
forestalled us 180 yeans ago.&nbsp; One or two curious instances
of spelling may here be given, showing that the schoolmaster was
not then much in evidence:&mdash;&ldquo;1703 Beuerils,
&amp;c.&rdquo;; &ldquo;1705 Bearths, Robert ye son of bniamen
hehuhinson (Benjamin Hewinson) and jane his wife was borne ye 15
day of january.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Burial.&nbsp; John Snow,
Inn-holder, July 3d., 1765&rdquo;; &ldquo;1707 Rebekah Leach was
beureid July the 10&rdquo;; &ldquo;1708 John Bouth and Doryty his
wife&rdquo;; &ldquo;Rebekah Langcaster 1725, the douter of Joseph
Langcaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;John Swingo the sun of John
Swingo and Ann his wife howous (was) Baptized the 17 of Aprill
1709.&rdquo;&nbsp; This name, in another entry, 1733, is given as
Swinsgo; the modern spelling is Swinscoe.</p>
<p>The names of some good families appear, as &ldquo;An the wife
of Will Hennag was buered ye 9 of Feberery, 1729&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Madame Elizabeth fines was buered May ye 29, 1730&rdquo;;
&ldquo;George soun of Mr. Clinton Whichcote 1624&rdquo;; and,
later, &ldquo;Mary the wife of John Gaunt, and Anthony, son of
John Gaunt, were buried Dec. 16, 1803.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hall, not
an ancient moated mansion, like so many described in these pages,
but yet one of some antiquity, has been occupied at different
times, by members of several leading county families, as Fynes,
Whichcote, Heneage, Dymoke, Pilkington, and Beaumont.&nbsp; It
has belonged to the Dymokes, as also the patronage of the
benefice, although Sir H. M. Hawley is lord of the manor.</p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth a family of Eastwoods was located
here, as the Records shew <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>that Andrew
Eastwood of Roughton was among the gentry who contributed

mortem, 22 Richard II., No. 13, taken at Market Staynton, the
feast of St. Luke the Evangelist (1399 <span

was shewn that &ldquo;Ralph de Cromwell, chivaler, held jointly
with his wife Matilda, besides other property, the manor of Tumby
with appurtenances in Rughton, Wodehall, Langton,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; And again, in a later Inquisition, post mortem, 13
Henry VII., No. 34, taken at Burwell, it was shewn that
&ldquo;the said Matilda Willughby died seised in fee tail of the

<p>In Domesday Book, the powerful Robert Despenser is named as
having in Roughton twelve oxgangs rateable to gelt, with three
sokemen, and a half sokeman holding two carucates of land with
three draught oxen; also fifteen acres of meadow land, a fishery
worth 2s. yearly, and forty acres of woodland, containing
pasturage in parts.&nbsp; The name is there given as
&ldquo;Roc-stune,&rdquo; whether from any Druidical boulder, or
sacred stone, or landmark, does not appear to be known.</p>
<p>From Roughton, going eastward by a ford on the river Bain, or
returning to Horncastle and taking the main road south-eastward,
we arrive, a little over two miles distant, at Scrivelsby, a
village which is unique in the kingdom, since there is but one
King&rsquo;s Champion, and he is &ldquo;Lord of
Scrivelsby.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we approach Scrivelsby <a
name="citation208c"></a><a href="#footnote208c"
class="citation">[208c]</a> Court, by a road shaded by stately
trees of hoar antiquity, with the well-wooded park on our left,
and fields, nicely timbered and interspersed with copses, on our
right, we pause, after a slight ascent, at a point where three
ways meet.&nbsp; Before us stands the &ldquo;Lion gateway,&rdquo;
a substantial arched stone structure with sculptured Lion
&ldquo;passant&rdquo; surmounting it; the Royal beast indicating
the official hereditary honour of the head of the family as the
Sovereign&rsquo;s Champion.&nbsp; On our right, in a humbler
position of less prominence, under the shade of trees, and green
with age, still <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>survive the parish stocks.&nbsp;
Thus the emblems of civil and military power confront each
other.&nbsp; The Court itself, standing some 150 yards from this
gateway, is approached through another arch in the wall of the
Courtyard.&nbsp; The present building is not one of large
proportions, the chief part of the old baronial residence having
been destroyed by fire about 130 years ago; to replace which
modern additions were made, on a smaller scale, early in the 19th
century.&nbsp; Of the portion destroyed a chief feature was a
very large hall, with wainscoted panels, on which &ldquo;were
depicted the arms and alliances of the family through its
numerous and far-traced descents.&rdquo; <a
name="citation209a"></a><a href="#footnote209a"
class="citation">[209a]</a>&nbsp; The chief features of interest
now remaining within are some of the suits of armour worn by
Champions, and a collection of &ldquo;Champion Cups.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The collection of armour was much finer a few years ago, but, on
the extinction of the line of the late Sir Henry Dymoke, most of
these were dispersed by sale, and the Cups were bequeathed to the
Queen, although Her Majesty, through the intermediation of the
late Right Honourable E. Stanhope, most graciously restored them
to the father of the present Champion.&nbsp; On the wall of the
&ldquo;Lion gateway,&rdquo; to the right of the arch, is a rebus,
or &ldquo;canting&rdquo; device, formed of a rude representation
of a tree dividing in a Y shape referring to an old-time emblem
of the family.&nbsp; As the Plantagenets had their &ldquo;planta
genista,&rdquo; the broom; so the Dymokes would seem to have had
their &ldquo;oak.&rdquo; <a name="citation209b"></a><a
href="#footnote209b" class="citation">[209b]</a>&nbsp; The <!--
page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>descent of the early Dymokes may be briefly given
thus:&mdash;Scrivelsby, forming part of the Soke of Horncastle,
of which the Conqueror held the manor, was given by William to
Robert Dispenser, his steward, whom we have several times named
in connection with other neighbouring parishes.&nbsp; From him it
passed, by some process unknown, to the Marmions.&nbsp; The last
Lord Marmyon died in 1292, and the Lincolnshire portion of his
estates,&mdash;for Sir Walter Scott describes him as</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lord of
Fontenay,<br />
Of Lutterworth and Scrivelsbay,<br />
Of Tamworth tower and town.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>passed to his younger daughter, Joan, whose granddaughter,
Margaret de Ludlow, married, in the reign of Edward III., Sir
John Dymoke, who acted as Champion at the coronation of Richard
II., and from that time, more than 500 years, the Dymokes have
acted in that capacity for their respective Sovereigns, down to
the last century, the ceremony, however, having been dispensed
with, to the regret of many, on the accessions of William IV.,
Queen Victoria, and our present Most Gracious Majesty King Edward
VII.</p>
<p>As this, formerly, State ceremony was so imposing, and of such
antiquity, it deserves more than a passing notice.&nbsp; We here
give a description of it, as observed at the coronation of Queen
Mary, from the account of Planch&eacute;, in the Royal
Records.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the close of the second course of the
Coronation Banquet, the Champion, Sir Edward Dymoke, entered
Westminster <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Hall, riding on a roan destrier (war
horse) trapped in cloth of gold, with a mace in one hand and a
gauntlet in the other.&nbsp; He was escorted to the upper end of
the hall by the Lord High Constable, and the Earl Marshall, and
the Herald of the Queen with a trumpet; and after he had made
obeisance to the Queen&rsquo;s highness, he turned him a little
aside, and with a loud voice made proclamation, &lsquo;If there
be any manner of man, of what estate, degree, or condition soever
he be, that will say, and maintain, that our Sovereign Lady Queen
Mary, this day here present, is not the rightful, and undoubted,
heretrix to the Imperial Crown of this realm of England, and that
of right she ought not to be crowned Queen, I say he lieth as a
false traitor, and that I am ready the same to maintain with him,
whilst I have breath in my body, either now at this time, or at
any other time, whensoever it shall please the Queen&rsquo;s
highness to appoint; and thereupon the same I cast him my
gage.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he cast the gauntlet from him, the which
no man would take up, till that a herald took it up and gave it
to him again.&nbsp; Then he proceeded to another place, and did
in this manner, in three several places in the said Hall.&nbsp;
Then he came to the upper end, and the Queen drank to him; and
after sent to him the cup, which he had for his fee, and likewise
the harness and trappings, and all the harness which he did
himself wear, and then he returned to the place from whence he
came, and was gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the last occasion, when this
ceremony was observed, viz., at the coronation of George IV., the
rightful champion being in Holy Orders, his son Henry, afterwards
Sir H. Dymoke, Bart., was allowed to act for his father, who was
the eighteenth of the hereditary champions of his family.&nbsp;
Sir Walter Scott was present, and, writing to a friend, says,
&ldquo;Young Dymoke is a fine-looking youth, but bearing perhaps
a little too much the appearance of a maiden knight to be a
challenger of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he adds, with the eye
of an antiquary, &ldquo;His armour was in good taste, except that
his shield was out of all propriety, being a round
&lsquo;Rondache,&rsquo; or Highland target, impossible to use on
horseback, instead of being a three-cornered, or leather, shield,
which, in the time of the Tilt, was suspended round the
neck.&nbsp; However, on the whole . . . the Lord of Scrivelsby
looked and behaved extremely well.&rdquo; <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>One <i>contre-temps</i>, however, occurred on this
occasion, which Sir Walter, perhaps, thought it polite, or
politic, not to mention; others have not had the same scruples,
and hence an incident is recorded which may have had something to
do with the future omission of the ceremony.&nbsp; The Duke of
Wellington, as Lord High Constable, had to ride by the
Champion&rsquo;s side, with the Deputy Earl Marshal on the other
side.&nbsp; It was part of the observance that, in withdrawing
from the Sovereign&rsquo;s presence, the riders should back their
horses, keeping their heads towards the King.&nbsp; The Duke, in
his anxiety that all should go without a hitch, had hired a horse
from Astley&rsquo;s circus, which had been specially trained for
that part of the ceremony; but, unfortunately, the intelligent
animal chose the wrong stage in the ceremony for the performance,
and most conscientiously and obstinately persisted in turning
tail and backing <i>towards</i> the King instead of from him, and
was with difficulty slewed round by the attendants. <a
name="citation212a"></a><a href="#footnote212a"
class="citation">[212a]</a></p>
<p>It were much to be desired that this picturesque and
interesting relic of feudal custom&rsquo;s might be
restored.&nbsp; The present may be an age of new-born energies,
and even revolutionary ideas, but the spirit of &ldquo;Reverentia
Cani&rdquo; is by no means extinguished, and the interest in old
institutions seems ever widening and deepening in the general
sentiment.</p>
<p>As a curiosity I will give here a bill, sent in by Sir Edward
Dymoke to Sir William Cecil (he spells it &ldquo;Syscell&rdquo;)
for the cost of some of the articles necessary to him as Champion
at the coronation of Mary, which he seems to have had a
difficulty in getting paid, although he was, by custom, entitled
to them.</p>

213</span>It may strike us as singular that so high an official
as the King&rsquo;s Champion should perpetrate such spelling as
the above; but those were days in which many a baron bold found
it easier to inscribe his name on the scroll of fame, by dint of
his trusty sword, than by the clerkly crowquill.</p>
<p>The church of Scrivelsby was thoroughly restored in 1861, and
further improvements made in 1876, the previous structure being a
poor one.&nbsp; Sir Henry added, at his own cost, a spire.&nbsp;
The most interesting features of the former building were
carefully retained.&nbsp; There is an aumbrey, in a curious
position, near the north-west door.&nbsp; The font is octagonal,
on pedestal, apparently modern, the faces having poppy head and
other simple devices.&nbsp; There is a tomb, of Lewis Dymoke,
under the reading desk, in the nave; in the north aisle, having
Early English columns of three bays, and eastward two bays with
Norman columns, there are recumbent figures of a knight and lady
(supposed to be Sir Philip Marmion and wife), the male figure
with shield, delapidated, the female entire.&nbsp; At the east
end of the same aisle is the tomb of Sir Robert Dymoke,
&ldquo;upon whose soule Almightie God have m&rsquo;ie.&nbsp;
Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a good rood screen in the
chancel.&nbsp; In 1899 a beautiful window was given, of coloured
glass, by Mrs. Dymoke, of the Court, in memory of her husband,
Francis Scaman Dymoke, the Hon. the Queen&rsquo;s Champion.&nbsp;
The subjects illustrated are (1) Our Lord preaching the sermon on
the Mount, and (2) in the act of blessing little children, under
the former of which are the words &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in
heart,&rdquo; and under the latter &ldquo;Suffer little children
to come unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the chancel is also a rich mural
monument to Lewis Dymoke, &ldquo;who performed the service at the
coronation of George I. and George II.&nbsp; He was the youngest
son of Sir Charles Dymoke and Eleanor eldest daughter of the
first Lord Rockingham.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are two other tablets,
on the north and south walls, of Dymokes, and others in the
floor; also a tablet to John Tyrwhitt, Esq., of Pentre Park, and
his wife Sophia, a Dymoke; and another of the Rev. I. <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>Bradshaw Tyrwhitt, of Wilksby.&nbsp; In the churchyard
are also tombs of Dymokes, one a massive structure opposite the
east window, containing the remains of the late Sir Henry Dymoke,
Bart., and Emma his wife.&nbsp; There are also many tombstones of
the Gilliat family.&nbsp; Some years ago, when repairs were being
made in the church, the flooring was removed, and a skeleton was
discovered without a head, a block of clay lying in place of the
skull.&nbsp; This was supposed to be the remains of Sir Thomas
Dymoke, who, with his relative, Lord Welles, was beheaded by
Edward IV., in London, at the time of the Battle of
&ldquo;Loosecoat field,&rdquo; near Stamford, 1470, when the
fugitive rebels threw off their coats to expedite their
flight.</p>
<p>Among the privileges of the Champion family was the right to
hold a market and fair at Scrivelsby, first granted, 42 and 43
Henry III., to Philip de Marmyon, to which he proved his claim in
the 9th year of Edwd. I.; also the right of free warren over the
Manor of Scrivelsby, and to erect a gallows for the punishment of
felons at Scrivelsby.&nbsp; Where the gallows were erected is not
known.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Dymoke, Sheriff of Lincolnshire 27 Henry VIII., and
also 1 Ed. VI. and 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, married Anne, sister
and coheir to Gilbert, Lord Taillebois of Kyme; by which alliance
the castle and manors of North and South Kyme came to the Dymoke
family, and members of the family resided there until it was
sold, about 1730, to the Duke of Newcastle.&nbsp; This Sir Edward
had issue Sir Robert Sir Charles, and a daughter Elizabeth, who
married Henry Ascough, a member of a very old and distinguished
family.&nbsp; Sir Robert Dymoke, Champion to James I., married
well, the daughter of Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton and Saye,
afterwards created Earl of Lincoln and a K.G.&nbsp; Her mother
had been the widow of Gilbert, Lord Taillebois, previously a
mistress of Hen. VII., by whom she had a son, created Duke of
Richmond.</p>
<p>Charles Dymoke, who died, unmarried, at Oxford in 1644, was a
zealous supporter of his unfortunate Sovereign, Charles I., and
by his Will bequeathed &pound;2,000 (a large sum in those days)
to relieve his necessities.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Dymoke, at the time of the Commonwealth, being,
from his office and his loyalty, obnoxious to the Republican
party, was fined, for his &ldquo;delinquency,&rdquo; &pound;200 a
year, and yet was obliged to pay the further, then enormous, sum
of &pound;4,633.</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>His son, Sir Charles, was highly esteemed for his
loyalty, and was put down among those who were to be created by
Charles II.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knights of the Royal Oak,&rdquo; in
grateful remembrance of the King being saved in an oak at
Boscobel in Staffordshire, resting on the lap of Colonel
Careless, afterwards Carlos.</p>
<p>The Dymokes&rsquo; estates were greatly reduced by sale in the
year 1871, when most, if not all, the lands not entailed were
disposed of.&nbsp; Within the writer&rsquo;s memory the Dymokes
shot over lands extending from their own door (with the exception
of the Ostler ground) to Kirkstead wharf.</p>
<p>We must here, however, pass on our way from Scrivelsby,
although we shall meet with Dymokes again in the next parish.</p>
<p>Taking an accommodation road <a name="citation215"></a><a
href="#footnote215" class="citation">[215]</a> which branches off
westward from the main road opposite the Lion gate, and going
through some fields, past the modern rectory, a substantial
residence, we emerge, by an old cottage, whose roof, covered with
ancient drab-coloured slates or slabs, reaches, on one side, to
the ground, upon another main road leading to Boston.&nbsp;
Pursuing this about a mile and a half, and passing a disused
churchyard, with two or three gravestones and no church, at
Dalderby, we reach the village of Haltham.&nbsp; Here we have a
church of considerable interest.&nbsp; Taking the exterior first,
we find a remarkable semi-circular tympanum over the door, within
the porch on the south.&nbsp; It has a kind of Maltese cross
within a circle, with a second circle running through the limbs
of the cross.&nbsp; Below this is a small round object, with an
oblong on each side of it; and below them, to the east, is an
oval figure like a buckle, while below, to the west, is a square,
having three-quarter circles at its corners, and semi-circles in
the middle of its sides, which form the extremities of a cross,
and between the limbs and the sides of the square are
roundels.&nbsp; Below this is a curious lobated object, with what
may be called a fish placed perpendicularly on it; east of the
circle <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>containing the Maltese cross are
four rows of inverted triangles, of different lengths; below
them, within a circle, is a curious figure, made of twelve
unequal curved lines, arranged in four groups of threes, and
forming a triple Fylfot or Swastica.&nbsp; Touching the east side
of this circle is another, which cuts into the border of the base
of the tympanum at its eastern corner, containing a cross within
a square similar to that on the west side.&nbsp; This very
curious tympanum is Early Norman, or possibly Saxon. <a
name="citation216"></a><a href="#footnote216"
class="citation">[216]</a>&nbsp; There is a priest&rsquo;s door
in the south wall of the chancel.&nbsp; There was once a north
door in the nave, now bricked up.&nbsp; There was a large western
door, round arched, with triple moulding, now also bricked
up.&nbsp; Over this door are two stone gurgoyles, one above the
other, let into recesses in the west wall, which is mainly of
brick.&nbsp; The length of the nave, externally, is 150ft.; and
its breadth, with the porch, is 150ft.&nbsp; The length of the
chancel is 30ft.&nbsp; The east window is a fine, decorated,
flamboyant specimen, its date being about 1350, which has been
copied on a larger scale, in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church,
Horncastle.</p>
<p>Taking the interior, the sittings are all of very old oak,
many of them with rudely carved poppy heads.&nbsp; There are very
fine, heavy, old oak, carved canopies over two long pews in the
north aisle for the Champion Dymokes and their servants.&nbsp;
These, probably, were taken from a former rood screen.&nbsp;
There is now a low screen, fragmentary, in the chancel, and an
oak pulpit, old but plain.&nbsp; There is a piscina, with two
fronts, in the south wall of the chancel, and a series of three
sedilia and an aumbrey in the north wall; also carved brackets on
each side of the east window.&nbsp; The font stands in the
north-east corner of the north aisle, on a very broad base which
serves as a seat.&nbsp; The north aisle has three bays with round
arches, and two eastward with pointed arches.&nbsp; The windows
throughout are perpendicular, but either square-topped or
debased, except the fine east window, and one in the south wall
of nave, of two lights.&nbsp; There is an incised slab to one of
the Dymokes.&nbsp; The bell chamber is closed by ancient boarding
adorned with the Commandments in old characters, and very curious
Royal arms of Charles I.&nbsp; There are three bells, and a very
curious old ladder, constructed of rude beams, <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>leading up
to the belfry.&nbsp; Miss Spurrier, the Rector&rsquo;s daughter,
assisted by the coachman, have improved the church by renovating
the screen.&nbsp; This lady has also carved a cover for the font
in very delicate pattern, the ironwork being done by the village
blacksmith, Mr. Priestley.</p>
<p>In the village is an old hostel, partly of the Tudor style,
with pointed gable ends, projecting upper story, and constructed,
externally, of brick and woodwork.</p>
<p>In the parish register, at the bottom of the page containing
the entries for the year 1584, by way of accounting for the
number of funerals (51), is the following note: &ldquo;This yeare
plague in Haltham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although Haltham and Roughton are
ecclesiastically united, and, in position, contiguous, there
were, in that year, no extra deaths in Roughton; while in the
year 1631&ndash;2 there were 43 burials at Roughton, and no
increase of mortality at Haltham.&nbsp; The only peculiar record
which I can find in connection with Haltham is a &ldquo;Feet of
Fines, Lincoln, 9 Henry III., No. 52,&rdquo; too long to be
quoted in full, which contains an agreement between Henry del
Ortiay and Sabina his wife on the one hand, and Ralph de Rhodes
on the other hand, tenant of lands with appurtenances, in
Horncastre, Upper Tynton, Cuningbye, Holtham, &amp;c., whereby
the said Henry and his wife recognise the said lands &amp;c. to
be the right of Ralph; he on his part granting to Henry and
Sabina other land with appurtenances, in Upper Tynton; certain of
the lands being designated Pese-wang, Leir-me-Wang, Whete-wang,
and Krunce Wong, with Hethotenacre (Heath of ten acre), Sexacre,
and other names.&nbsp; These names illustrate what was said on a
previous page regarding the field named &ldquo;the Wong,&rdquo;
at Horncastle.&nbsp; A very curious feature of the agreement is
that the said Henry and Sabina are &ldquo;to have and to
hold&rdquo; these lands &ldquo;of the aforesaid Ralph and his
heirs forever, rendering therefor, by the year, one pair of gilt
spurs, or 6d., at Easter, for all service and exaction.&rdquo; <a

<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>Having thus made our halt at Haltham, we bid adieu to
the place, and push on southward.&nbsp; Passing Tumby Lawn, the
residence of Sir H. M. Hawley, surrounded by leafy groves, within
whose shade (teste scriptore) Philomel doth pour forth
(malgr&eacute; the poets) <i>his</i> flood of song, while a whole
coterie of other birds in &ldquo;amorous descant&rdquo; join; and
sheltered from the east by the extensive woods of Haltham,
Fulsby, and Tumby, remains of the whilom &ldquo;Tumby
Chase,&rdquo; we find ourselves, at the end of some three and a
half miles, entering the main street of Coningsby.&nbsp; Here
again, we might ask, with love-sick Juliet, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
in a name?&rdquo;&nbsp; But, in sooth, a name may be an epitome
of history.&nbsp; There is an old proverb that &ldquo;knowledge
is power,&rdquo; and we might say, the name of Coningsby is a
territorial exemplification and perpetuation of this adage.&nbsp;
In the language once spoken in these parts, <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a> the conning, cunning man and the king
were one and the same; the king <i>was</i> king because he was
the conner, the thinker, and so overtopped his fellows in
cunning.&nbsp; He embodied in his own person the moral of every
age of progress, that brute force must yield the palm to skill
and judgment.&nbsp; Mob-rule may for a while snatch at, and hold,
the mastery; but &rsquo;tis the man who has the cunning to bide
his time, and then seize the opportunity, who will be borne in
triumph on the shoulders of those who once hustled and jostled
him.&nbsp; Within some miles northward of where I am writing lies
Kingthorpe, &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s village&rdquo;; and at just
about the same distance <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>southward
lies Coningsby, with precisely the same meaning.&nbsp; Both names
imply the presence at one time of a king; who he may have been we
do not know, but he put down his foot there, and the stamp
remains.&nbsp; There was once a castellated residence here, the
home of the Coningsby family; and one of them, Thomas, was
created Earl of Coningsby, but, dying without issue, the title
became extinct in 1729.&nbsp; I may here mention that the tomb of
the last Countess of Coningsby is in the north chantry chapel of
Heydour church (between Sleaford and Grantham); it is a marble
monument by Rijsbrach.&nbsp; There is also a slab to the last
Viscount, 1733, who is traditionally said to have been taken from
his cradle by a pet monkey, and dropped by it, in the terror of
pursuit, from the roof of the house on to the stone pavement
below, and so killed.&nbsp; The position of this old Coningsby
mansion is not precisely known; but in a field on the south side
of the main street there is an ancient dove-cot, and some fine
trees, such as one might expect about a baronial residence.&nbsp;
The Coningsbys moved from Coningsby to Hampton Court in
Herefordshire more than two centuries ago. <a
name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a>&nbsp; There was a very fine
collection of pictures at this place, a list of which was given
in the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; of April 26,
1826.&nbsp; Among these was a painting of the old mansion of
Coningsby.&nbsp; Hampton Court is now the residence of John
Arkwright, Esq., and is situated between Hereford and
Leominster.&nbsp; But &ldquo;vixere fortes ante
Agamemnona,&rdquo; and there were men of mark at Coningsby long
before those who took its name as their patronymic.&nbsp; In
Domesday Book we find that Sortibrand, the son of Ulf, the Saxon,
who was one of the Lagmen of Lincoln, and had &ldquo;sac and soc
<a name="citation219b"></a><a href="#footnote219b"
class="citation">[219b]</a> over three mansions in that
city,&rdquo; as successor to his father (loco Ulf patris sui),
held a berewick (a corn farm) in Coningsby.</p>
<p>When the powerful favourite of the Conqueror, Robert
Despenser, laid claim to a fishery and certain land in Coningsby,
the Jurymen of the Wapentake of Horncastle decided that his claim
was good, because Achi, his Saxon predecessor, <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>had held
the same in the time of Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; Moreover, the
said Robert Despenser already held in Coningsby a
berewick&mdash;&ldquo;bere&rdquo; (barley) land&mdash;of nine
oxgangs, or some 225 acres, of meadow and wood, besides land in a
score more parishes.&nbsp; And, again, from the same source we
learn that a noble Fleming, Drogo de Bruere, who fought under the
Conqueror at the battle of Hastings, and was rewarded by the gift
of the whole of Holderness in Yorkshire, and other manors in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere, also held land in Coningsby.&nbsp; Of
this noble, Camden relates that the Conqueror valued his services
so highly that he bestowed his own niece upon him in marriage;

all attempts to discover him having failed down to the time of

<p>In the List of the Gentry of Lincolnshire, made on the
Herald&rsquo;s Visitation of the county in 1634, and still
preserved at the Herald&rsquo;s College, are the names of John
Carter and Clinton Whichcote, of Coningsby. <a

<p>In a Chancery Inquisition, post mortem, taken 31st May, 10
Henry VII., No. 72 (1495), it was found that Robert Taillebois,
Knight, and John Gygour, Clerk, Warden of the College of
Tatteshale, were &ldquo;seized in their demesne as of fee of the
manors of South Kyme, North Kyme, Conyngsby, Dokdyke,
Byllingay,&rdquo; and other properties. <a
name="citation220c"></a><a href="#footnote220c"
class="citation">[220c]</a>&nbsp; While, as an evidence of the
trade of Coningsby, in a list of &ldquo;Lincolnshire Town and
Traders&rsquo; Tokens,&rdquo; made by the late Mr. C. J. Caswell,
of Horncastle, there occurs one of a Coningsby tradesman, bearing
on the obverse side, &ldquo;John Lupton&mdash;The Baker&rsquo;s
Arms,&rdquo; and on the reverse side, &ldquo;Of Cunsby,
1663&mdash;J. A. L.&rdquo; <a name="citation220d"></a><a
href="#footnote220d" class="citation">[220d]</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Caswell adds a note that &ldquo;where three initials are given,
as in this case, the issuer&rsquo;s wife is included, sometimes
<!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>joined in a true lover&rsquo;s knot.&nbsp; Mr. John
Lupton (in the present day) is a well-known and respected farmer
of Pinchbeck West.&nbsp; His daughter married T. A. Roberts,
Esq., M.R.C.S., late of Coningsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have already, in connection with Haltham, quoted an old
Record, Feet of Fines, 9 Henry III., No. 52, which gives an
agreement between Henry del Ortiay and Sabina his wife, as
plaintiffs, on the one part, and Ralph de Rhodes on the other
part, holding lands in Coningsby, Haltham, Marynge (Mareham), and
other places; by which they recognise these lands as his by
right, and, in return, he assigns certain land to them in Upper
Tynton, to have and to hold for ever, by the tenure of a pair of
gilt spurs, given annually.&nbsp; This brings this powerful baron
into connection with Coningsby. <a name="citation221a"></a><a
href="#footnote221a" class="citation">[221a]</a>&nbsp; While
further, in a Feet of Fines, 19 Henry VII. (1503), on the Octave
of Holy Trinity, an agreement is given between Sir Edward
Ponyngs, Knt., Sir Thomas Fenys (Fynes?), Knt., Sir John Peeche,
Knt., John Mordaunt, and others, plaintiffs, on the one part, and
Sir George Nevyll, of Burgavenny, Knight, and Joan his wife,
deforciants, whereby George and Joan recognise certain lands in
Conysby, Halton, Belcheford, and elsewhere, to be the right of
John Mordaunt, for which the plaintiffs gave them &pound;l,000.
<a name="citation221b"></a><a href="#footnote221b"
class="citation">[221b]</a>&nbsp; Here we have another
proprietor, John Mordaunt, brought into connection with
Coningsby, and that he was a man of substance was shewn by the
fact that this recognition of his property was not confined to
Coningsby, but extended to the manor of Estwardesbersoke, etc.,
in Notts.; the manors of Halton, Aukebarow, and Burton Stather;
lands in Winterton, Theylby, Hybalstede, Barnaby, Eyrby, Crosby,
Gunnall, Donyngton, etc.&nbsp; Further, by Feet of Fynes, 21
Henry VII. (1505), an agreement is given between Richard, Bishop
of Winchester, Sir Giles Daubeney, of Daubeney, Knight; Sir T.
Lovell, Sir R. Emson, Sir James Hobart, <i>Humphrey
Conyngesby</i>, one of the King&rsquo;s Sergeants at Law, and
others, as plaintiffs, and Robert Ratclyfe de Fitzwater, and
Margaret Ratclyfe, widow of Sir John Ratclyfe de Fitzwater,
deforciants; whereby Robert and Margaret recognise the castle of
Egremound, and various other manors and properties, to be the
right of the Bishop.</p>
<p><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>Further, it is known that the manor of Coningsby was
formerly held by the Marmyons, and they and their descendants,
the Dymokes, were largely commemorated in stained-glass windows
once existing in the church; and a tombstone records the
&ldquo;Hic jacet&rdquo; of Anna, daughter of Thomas Dymoke, and
his wife &ldquo;que obijt A&deg; Dni 1462.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
manorial rights ultimately passed to the Heathcotes, and are now
the property of the head of that family, the Earl of
Ancaster.</p>
<p>Let us now look at the church; and, taking the exterior first,
we are struck by the fine tower, which is visible for many miles
round.&nbsp; It is of the Perpendicular order, very plain;
indeed, almost without ornament, except for the roses on the
cuspings of the upper window; but it is of solid, good ashlar
work, well supported by buttresses, and its outline relieved by
several set-offs.&nbsp; It is pierced, below, by an arched
passage, through which there is a public thoroughfare, existing
from time immemorial, <a name="citation222"></a><a
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> the supposition
being, that the monks of Croyland and other southern monasteries,
on their way to Kirkstead, and their more northern brethren,
&ldquo;baited&rdquo; at the rectory hard by, where there are
still traces of a large refectory in the presence of an arch of
wide span, which runs through the oldest part of the house, from
top to bottom.&nbsp; In the east and west walls, on either side
of this tower arch, is a sex-foiled, circular window; that on the
east being in the west wall of the nave, and filled with coloured
glass; that on the west, being in the outside wall of the tower,
has never been glazed.&nbsp; In the south-eastern wall of the
porch is a stoup, which formerly was open both within the porch
and outside, though now it is closed outside.&nbsp; Built into
the west wall of the south aisle, probably at the restoration in
1872, is a block of stone, carved with a closed hand, having a
finely-laced cuff.&nbsp; This is, doubtless, an importation from
elsewhere.&nbsp; Near the top of the wall of a cupola-shaped
south finial of the rood-loft turret, is an old sun-dial.&nbsp;
Taking now the interior, we find a massive heavy roof, of beams
somewhat rudely hewn, with traces of former colouring still
perceptible.&nbsp; The four western bays of the arcade are Early
English, with low arches rising from octagonal piers; the
easternmost bay seems to have been an addition at a <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>later date; some of the piers, two on the north and one
on the south, have been heightened, and the arches are higher and
wider.&nbsp; The moulding between two of the north arches
terminates in a head, on each side of which an evil spirit is
whispering.&nbsp; Another terminal is the head of a woman wearing
the &ldquo;branks,&rdquo; or scold&rsquo;s bridle. <a
name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a>&nbsp; The clerestory windows were
spoilt at the restoration, when their height had to be
reduced.&nbsp; Externally their original design remains&mdash;two
lancet windows over each arch; but internally the lancets have
been cut short and converted into triangular lights with curved
sides.&nbsp; On the south side of the chancel arch is a rood-loft
staircase turret, of which both the upper and lower doorways
remain.&nbsp; The chancel east end is apsidal, modern, and out of
keeping with the rest of the structure.&nbsp; There are three
two-light windows in the three faces of the apse.&nbsp; In one of
these the present rector, Canon Arthur Wright, has placed a
two-light memorial window, to his deceased wife, of some
beauty.&nbsp; South of the Communion table, attached to the wall
as a credence table, is an Early English capital, with piscina
behind.&nbsp; The windows in the north aisle are decorated with
reticulated tracery.&nbsp; Those of the south aisle are
Perpendicular, with segmented heads.&nbsp; The windows throughout
the church, and extending even to the rectory house, were, at a
former period, unusually rich in stained glass,</p>
<blockquote><p>With varied hues all richly dight,<br />
In radiance and collateral light,<br />
Of knight&rsquo;s and baron&rsquo;s heraldic scroll,<br />
And prayers invoked for manie a soule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The marvel is, what has become of it, since there is no record
of any act of spoliation such as is known to have been committed
in the neighbouring church of Tattershall.&nbsp; We give here
extracts from Gervase Holles&rsquo; &ldquo;Notes on
Churches,&rdquo; descriptive of these windows, etc., from the
Harleyan MSS., No. 6,829, as they are given in Weir&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History,&rdquo; pp. 50&ndash;52, ed. 1820.</p>

<p>The font is plain, octagonal, Early English.&nbsp; In the
centre of the nave are two slabs, once having had brasses, but
these are no longer <i>in situ</i>.&nbsp; Over the porch is a
parvis, as a priest&rsquo;s chamber, or school.&nbsp; The church
has a clock and six bells.&nbsp; The curfew, or
<i>ignitegium</i>, was rung down to within the last thirty
years.&nbsp; Among the Rectors have been two poets, one of them
the Laureate of his day (1718), the Rev. Laurence Eusden, who
died in 1730.&nbsp; A man originally &ldquo;of some parts,&rdquo;
by inordinate flattery he obtained that distinction, which,
however, invited criticism; and his mediocre abilities,
accompanied by habits somewhat intemperate, provoked
ridicule.&nbsp; Among other productions, he translated into Latin
Lord Halifax&rsquo;s poem on &ldquo;The Battle of the
Boyne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope refers to him, in his
&ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Know, Eusden thirsts no more for sack or
praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sleeps among the dull of ancient days;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe, where no critics d---n, nor
duns molest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another writer says of him,</p>
<blockquote><p>Eusden, a laurell&rsquo;d bard, by fortune
raised,<br />
By very few men read, by fewer praised;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while the Duke of Buckingham, describing, in a
&ldquo;skit,&rdquo; the contest for the Laureateship, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>In rushed Eusden, and cryed, &ldquo;Who shall have
it?<br />
But I, the true Laureate, to whom the king gave it?&rdquo;<br />
Apollo begged pardon, and granted his claim,<br />
But vowed that till then he&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er heard of his
name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Dyer, born 1700, was a much more reputable person.&nbsp;
He was educated at Westminster; began life as an itinerant
artist, with a keen eye to the beauties of nature, when that
taste was little cultivated.&nbsp; He was appointed to the
rectory by Sir John Heathcote in 1752, and in 1755 to
Kirkby-on-Bain, for which he exchanged Belchford, where he had
formerly been.&nbsp; He was the author of &ldquo;Grongar
Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fleece,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Ruins of
Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was honoured with a sonnet by Wordsworth;
but his longer poems are somewhat wearisome reading.</p>
<p>The place-names in this parish indicate the condition of
woodland and waste which formerly prevailed.&nbsp; Immediately
south of the church and its surroundings we find the
&ldquo;Ings,&rdquo; or meadows, the Saxon term which we have
noticed in several other parishes.&nbsp; Further off, <!-- page
227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>we
have &ldquo;Oaklands&rdquo; farm, and &ldquo;Scrub-hill,&rdquo;
&ldquo;scrub&rdquo; being an old Lincolnshire word for a small
wood; as we have, in the neighbourhood, &lsquo;Edlington
Scrubs&rsquo; and &lsquo;Roughton Scrubs.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Reedham,&rdquo; another name, indicates a waste of
morass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toot-hill&rdquo; might be a raised ground
from which a watch, or look-out, was kept, in troublous times;
and Dr. Oliver says, in his &ldquo;Religious Houses,&rdquo;
Appendix, p. 166, &ldquo;&lsquo;Taut&rsquo; is a place of
observation; &lsquo;Touter&rsquo; is a watcher in hiding;&rdquo;
but it is more likely to be from the Saxon &ldquo;tot,&rdquo; an
eminence (&ldquo;totian,&rdquo; to rise), in which case the
second syllable, &ldquo;hill,&rdquo; is only a later translation
of the first.&nbsp; However, Toot-hill, Tothill, or
Tooter&rsquo;s hill, are not uncommon in other parts, and are
said to have been connected with the heathen worship of
Taith.&nbsp; Langworth Grange, in this parish, would probably be
(as elsewhere) a corruption of Langwath, the long ford over some
of the fenny stretches of water.&nbsp; The most peculiar
place-name is &ldquo;Troy-wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is possible that,
as at Horncastle, this may have been a place where the youths
gathered to play the old game of &ldquo;Troy town&rdquo;; but is
more likely of British origin, a remnant of the Fenland
Grirvii.&nbsp; Troy Town is a hamlet near Dorchester, but there
are several spots in Wales named Caer-troi, which means a
bending, or tortuous town, a labyrinth, such as the Britons made
with banks of turf.</p>
<p>We have now about done with Coningsby.&nbsp; We are welcome to
enter the rectory, where we notice the large arch, already
referred to, of the former refectory.&nbsp; Other objects of
interest may be shewn us by the Rector, but we turn to the
western window of the drawing-room to gaze upon a sight
unparalleled.&nbsp; Not a mile away there rises up before us the
stately structure of Tattershall Castle, &ldquo;the finest piece
of brickwork in the kingdom&rdquo;; and, close by, beneath, as it
were, its sheltering wing, the collegiate church, almost, in its
way, as grand an object.&nbsp; <i>L&rsquo;appetit vient en
mangeant</i>; and, as we devour the prospect, we hunger and
thirst for a closer acquaintance with their attractions.</p>
<p>Leaving Coningsby, and proceeding westward, we reach the
bridge which spans the Horncastle canal.&nbsp; Here we pause to
turn round and take a look behind us eastward.&nbsp; The massive
tower of Coningsby rises far above the trees of the rectory
precincts, themselves of a considerable height.&nbsp; Looking
along the canal, the eye rests upon a very Dutch-like scene; the
sleepy waters of the so-called &ldquo;Navigation&rdquo; fringed
by tall <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>elms growing on its southern margin,
and on its northern by decaying willows, studding the meadows,
which are richly verdant from the damp atmosphere which it
engenders; a slowly-crawling barge or two might formerly have
been seen, with horse and driver on the towing path; but they are
now things of the past.&nbsp; The canal, on its opening in 1801,
was expected to be a mine of wealth to the shareholder&rsquo;s,
but, having been ruined by the railway, it is now disused; in
parts silted up and only a bed of water plants; in other parts
its banks have given way, and the bed is dry.&nbsp; Its only
present utility is to add picturesqueness to a scene of still
life.&nbsp; Following the towing path westward, with the
straggling street of Tattershall on the other side of the water,
we reach what is called a &ldquo;staunch,&rdquo; a weir, over
which the surplus carnal water discharges itself into what was
the original channel of the river Bain, <a
name="citation228"></a><a href="#footnote228"
class="citation">[228]</a> which, between Horncastle and here,
has been more than once utilised to replenish the canal.&nbsp;
Not far off, down this small stream, are some favourite haunts of
the speckled trout; and beneath overhanging willows fine chub may
be seen poising themselves in the water sleepily.&nbsp; We now
leave the towing path and enter the main street, with church and
castle close at hand to our left, but first we will go a hundred
yards to the right, and make for the Marketplace.&nbsp; By the
gift of &ldquo;a well-trained hawk,&rdquo; Robert Fitz-Eudo, in
1201, obtained from King John a charter for holding a weekly
market; and the shaft and broad base of the market cross, bearing
the arms of Cromwell, Tateshall, and D&rsquo;Eyncourt, with a
modern substitute for the cross on the top, still exists.&nbsp;
An old brick building, in a yard on the south side of the
Market-place, now used for malting, is traditionally said to have
been the original, and smaller, church, before the present one
was erected in the 15th century.</p>
<p>As prefatory to our examination of both castle and church, we
give here a brief notice of the owners of this barony, and the
founder of both these erections.&nbsp; Among the Norman knights
who accompanied the Conqueror in his great venture against Harold
for the throne of England,&mdash;<!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>and we can
hardly help reflecting on the vast deviation in the stream of
English history which would have followed if that &ldquo;bow
drawn at a venture&rdquo; had not sent a shaft through the eye
and brain of Harold at Hastings,&mdash;there were, as Camden
tells us, <a name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a> two sworn brothers in arms, Eudo and
Pinso, to whom William, as the reward of their prowess, assigned
certain territories, to be held by them in common, as they had
themselves made common cause in has service.&nbsp; They
subsequently divided these possessions, and the Barony of
Tattershall, with Tattershall Thorpe and other
appendages,&mdash;among them two-thirds of Woodhall,&mdash;fell
to the share of Eudo.&nbsp; He was succeeded, in due course, by
his son, Hugh Fitz-Eudo, surnamed Brito, or, the Breton; who, in
1139 founded a monastery for Cistercian monks at Kirkstead.&nbsp;
The male line of this family continued for some eight
generations.&nbsp; His grandson Philip died, when sheriff of the
county, in 1200; his great grandson Robert married, first, Lady
Mabel, eldest sister and co-heir of Hugh de Albini, <a
name="citation229b"></a><a href="#footnote229b"
class="citation">[229b]</a> 5th Earl of Sussex and Arundel,
represented now by the Dukes of Norfolk (Earls of Arundel),
hereditary Earl-Marshals and Chief Butlers of England; and,
secondly, a daughter of John de Grey.&nbsp; This Robert obtained,
in 1231, permission from Hen. III. to rebuild the family
residence of stone.&nbsp; As to this permission, it may be
observed that castle-building had been carried on so extensively
in the reign of Stephen, and the powerful barons, backed by their
fortified residences, had proved themselves so formidable, that
it was deemed politic to prevent further erections of this kind,
except with the Royal licence. <a name="citation229c"></a><a
href="#footnote229c" class="citation">[229c]</a>&nbsp; This would
be the first substantially-fortified structure at this place, but
of this building there is not now left one stone upon another;
views, however, of the castle, drawn by Buck, in 1727, shew that
there were then remaining <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>extensive
buildings, whose style would seen to correspond with the date of
this licence.&nbsp; This Robert, having married two wives, who
were heiresses, would be a wealthy and important personage; he
died in 1249.&nbsp; Two more Roberts succeeded in their turn; the
second of them being summoned to Parliament, as 1st Baron de
Tateshall, in 1297, died in the year following.&nbsp; On the
death of his grandson, another Robert, and 3rd Baron, without
issue, in 1305, the estates reverted to his three aunts, Emma,
Joan, and Isabella, the second of whom, married to Robert de
Driby, inherited Tattershall.&nbsp; Their two sons dying, the
property again reverted to a female, viz., their daughter Alice,
married to Sir William Bernak, Lord of Woodthorp, co. Lincoln,
who died 1339.&nbsp; His son, Sir John Bernak, married Joan,
daughter and co-heir of Robert, 2nd Baron Marmyon, who died 1345;
and, on the death of his two sons, the property, for a third
time, passed to a female, in the person of his daughter Maude,
who married Sir Ralph Cromwell.&nbsp; He was summoned to
Parliament as Baron Cromwell in 1375, and died in 1398.&nbsp; His
grandson, the 3rd Baron, also a Ralph, married Margaet, sister
and co-heir of William, last Baron D&rsquo;Eyncourt.&nbsp; These
several marriages with heiresses had largely augmented the
estates and wealth of the successive families, and this Ralph,
being made Lord Treasurer in 1433 by Henry VI., levelled the
older castle to the ground, and, having obtained the Royal
licence to rebuild, he erected the present majestic pile in 1440,
at a cost, as William of Worcester informs us, <a
name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230"
class="citation">[230]</a> of 4,000 marks.&nbsp; At this palatial
residence, and in London, he lived in great state, his household
consisting of 100 persons, and his suite, when he rode to London,
commonly comprised 120 horsemen; his annual expenditure being
&pound;5,000.&nbsp; In a previous chapter we quoted a charge made
upon Lord Clinton, when living at Tattershall, for 1,000
faggots.&nbsp; At Hurstmonceux Castle, a similar building to
Tattershall, the oven is described by Dugdale (&ldquo;Beauties of
England&mdash;Sussex,&rdquo; p. 206) as being 14ft. long.&nbsp;
In such a furnace the daily consumption of faggots would not be a
trifle.</p>
<p>To speak here for a moment of building in brick.&nbsp; From
the ordinarily unsightly character of brick structures it is
usual to regard brick-building disparagingly, but we have only to
go to Italy, the hereditary land of Art in various <!-- page
231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>forms, to see edifices unsurpassed for beauty in the
world, which are constructed wholly, or in part, of brick.&nbsp;
The Cathedral at Cremona, with its delicately-moulded Rose
windows and its Torrazo, 400ft. in height; those of St.
Pantaleone, Pavia; of the Broletto, Brescia; or the Ducal Palace
at Mantua, with its rich windows; or the Palazzo dei Signori at
Verona, with tower 300ft. high; not to mention more, are all
splendid specimens of what can be achieved in brick.&nbsp; In
England, nothing like these has ever been attempted; the only
modern church of brick worth a mention is that of All Saints,
Margaret Street, London, with its graceful spire.&nbsp; In the
15th century, and slightly earlier, a few substantial and
finely-constructed erections of brick were made, of which one of
the earliest, if not the earliest, was the magnificent Gate Tower
of Layer Marney in Essex, built by the 1st Lord Marney, and for
which he is said to have imported Italian workmen for the moulded
bricks.&nbsp; Owing to his death the entire structure was not
completed.&nbsp; But the gateway, flanked by two octagonal
towers, each of eight stories; and the summit, chimneys and
divisions of windows, with their varied mouldings, are a very
fine piece of work. <a name="citation231a"></a><a
href="#footnote231a" class="citation">[231a]</a>&nbsp; Another of
these brick structures, of about the same date, was Torksey
Castle, in our own county; another was Hurstmonceux Castle, in
Sussex, said by Dugdale <a name="citation231b"></a><a
href="#footnote231b" class="citation">[231b]</a> to be the only
one at all rivalling Tattershall; while, by a curious
coincidence, its founder was Sir Roger de Fiennes, one of the
family, which, at a later period, owned Tattershall.</p>
<p>As we stand before Tattershall Castle and gaze on its stately
proportions, we cannot but feel that brick, properly, treated,
can rival stone.&nbsp; What remains now is probably barely a
third of what the building originally was, and stands, doubtless,
on the site previously occupied by the Keep of the earlier
castle.&nbsp; It is a type of a particular stage of construction,
when the palace was superseding the grim feudal fortress,
although retaining several of the warlike features.&nbsp; Besides
an inner moat, completely surrounding the castle, there was also
an outer one, protecting it on the north and west. <a
name="citation231c"></a><a href="#footnote231c"
class="citation">[231c]</a>&nbsp; Both these moats were supplied
with <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>water from the river Bain, and they
had an inter-connection by a cut on the north side of the castle,
close by which there was a small machicolated tower, probably
connected with a drawbridge.&nbsp; On the space between the moats
were buildings detached, serving for barracks, guardrooms, etc.,
and one of these, now used as a barn, opposite the north-west
angle of the castle, is still fairly perfect.&nbsp; The entrance
to the inner castle court, on the north-east, was defended by a
lofty gateway, with portcullis, and flanked by two turrets, which
were still remaining when Buck&rsquo;s drawings were made, in
1727.&nbsp; This noble keep, in Treasurer Cromwell&rsquo;s time,
had at least five groups of noble buildings about it; so that we
can now hardly conceive the imposing appearance of the
whole.&nbsp; What remains is 89ft. in length, by 67ft. in width,
rising boldly into the air, slightly sloping inwards as it rises,
to give a greater idea of height, until its turret parapets are
found to be 112ft. from the ground; while its massive walls, the
eastern one 16ft. thick at the base, are in keeping with its
large proportions.&nbsp; The variety of outline in the well-set
windows, the shadow-casting angle turrets, and the massive
machicolations, all serve to relieve the structure of
monotony.&nbsp; The red bricks, too, are varied by having others
of a dark grey tint introduced in reticulated patterns, which
relieve without being obtrusive.&nbsp; As I have observed
elsewhere, a geologist of experience states that both the bricks
and the locally-termed grouting, or mortar, are alike made from
local material. <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a>&nbsp; The covered gallery on the
summit of the keep, surrounded by battlements, pierced with
windows, and partly pendent over the machicolations, though said
to be unique in this country, is a feature not uncommon in France
and Germany.&nbsp; The internal arrangement of four grand
apartments, one above another, is similar to that of Kirkby
Muxloe, but it is now difficult to assign to them their
particular uses.&nbsp; Nothing remains of these apartments beyond
their windows, three beautiful stone mantelpieces, and two or
three massive oak bauk-beams.&nbsp; Of one of the latter, now
gone, the writer has a rather gruesome <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>recollection.&nbsp; In the reckless hardihood of youth,
there were few parts of the castle which were not reached by
himself and his not less daring companions; and, in a moment of
heedless adventure, on jackdaws&rsquo; eggs intent, he walked
across one of these beams from the eastern gallery to the western
wall, with nothing but empty space between him and the ground, 70
or 80 feet below.&nbsp; He performed this feat safely, but a few
days afterwards the beam fell.&nbsp; At that time, in the
forties, <a name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a> three of the corner turrets had
conical roofs covered with lead.&nbsp; The writer&rsquo;s name
was cut in the lead of the most inaccessible of these, as well as
on several other places, still to be seen.&nbsp; The lead has
been sold, and the roofs removed, long ago.&nbsp; Within these
roofs was a complicated network of supporting beams, crossing and
re-crossing each other, among which pigeons, and even owls,
nested.&nbsp; A schoolfellow of the writer clambered up into one
of these, bent on plunder, but the beams were too rotten to bear
his weight, and he fell to the floor, some 15 or 18 feet, on to
the hard bricks.&nbsp; No bones, fortunately, were broken, but he
sustained such a shock that he was confined to his bed for some
weeks.&nbsp; But a more remarkable escape occurred at a later
date.&nbsp; Visiting the castle, a dozen or more yeans ago, while
the writer was looking down to the basement from the topmost
gallery, close to the foot of the small staircase which leads to
the flat roof of the south-eastern turret, the son of a farmer in
the parish came up to him and said, in the most unconcerned
manner, &ldquo;Sir, my brother fell from here to the bottom
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, with surprise, &ldquo;Was he
not killed on the spot?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the
answer, &ldquo;he was only a little shaken.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy,
probably about 10 or 11 years old, was wearing a smock frock,
loose below, but fastened fairly tight about the neck.&nbsp; In
search of eggs, I presume, he sprang across the open space below
him, from the eastern gallery to a ledge running along the south
wall, but, in attempting to do this, his shoulder struck the
brickwork of the corner turret, which spun him round, and he
fell.&nbsp; His smock frock, however, filled with air, and buoyed
him up, thus checking the rapidity of his descent, and he
alighted on the ground upon a heap of small sticks and twigs
dropped by the jackdaws, and the result was <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>little more
than a severe shaking.&nbsp; We have noticed the handsome
mantelpieces, which are referred to and engraved in several
publications.&nbsp; They are ornamented with the
Treasurer&rsquo;s purse and the motto &ldquo;N&rsquo;ai j&rsquo;
droit,&rdquo; and other heraldic devices of the Tattershall,
Driby, Bernak, Cromwell, D&rsquo;Eyncourt, Grey of Rotherfield,
and Marmyon families, a study for the genealogist.&nbsp; Nor may
we forget the vaulted gallery on the third floor, with bosses of
cement and beautifully-moulded brickwork in its roof.&nbsp; This
fine old ruin has not only suffered from the ravages of time, but
the elements have also played havoc with it.&nbsp; On March 29,
1904, at 2.30 p.m., in a violent thunderstorm, it was struck by
lightning.&nbsp; The &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; fell on the north-east
corner tower, hurling to the ground, inside and outside, massive
fragments of the battlemented parapet.&nbsp; The electric fluid
then passed downward, through the building, emerging by a window
of the third storey, in the western side, tearing away several
feet of masonry, and causing a great rent in the solid wall
beneath.&nbsp; The writer inspected the damage within a few days
of the occurrence, and was astonished at the violence of the
explosion.</p>
<p>After the extinction of the Cromwell line the estates probably
reverted to the Crown, as we find that Henry VII. granted the
manor of Tattershall, and other properties, to his mother,
Margaret, Countess of Richmond; and in the following year he
entailed them on the Duke.&nbsp; On the Duke dying without issue,
Henry VIII., in 1520, granted these properties to Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, by letters patent, which were confirmed
by Ed. VI. in the year 1547.&nbsp; On the deaths of the two
infant sons of the Duke, shortly after the father&rsquo;s
decease, Ed. VI., in 1551, granted the estate to Edward, Lord
Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl of Lincoln, whose descendant,
Edward, died without issue in 1692, when the property passed to
his cousin Bridget, who married Hugh Fortescue, Esq., whose son
Hugh was created Baron Fortescue and Earl Clinton in 1746; and
the estates have continued in that family ever since.</p>
<p>We now pass to the church.&nbsp; As the castle was a sample of
transition from the feudal fortress to the baronial palace, so
the church, although of the Perpendicular order, is not quite of
the purest type, being of the later Perpendicular period.&nbsp;
Begun by the Treasurer Cromwell, it was not completed at his
death in 1455, but the work was carried on and finished by his
executors, one of whom was William of Wykeham, <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Bishop of
Winchester, the most famous building prelate of his time.&nbsp;
It has been noticed, by competent judges, that there is &ldquo;a
remarkable resemblance in points of detail, in the churches built
or enlarged by Ralph, Lord Cromwell, at Colly Weston, Northants;
Lambley, Notts.; and Tattershall,&rdquo; as is the case with
other groups of edifices erected by the same parties.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Arch&aelig;olog. Journ.,&rdquo; No. 12, 1846, pp.
291&ndash;2.)&nbsp; It was established as a collegiate
institution, with provision for a provost, six priests, six
secular clerks, and six choristers.&nbsp; Dedicated to the
Trinity, it is a noble stone structure, in shape cruciform, with
nave, aisles, and north and south transepts, chancel, north and
south porches, and tower at the west end.&nbsp; There were
formerly cloisters on the south side, but they were
demolished.&nbsp; The tower is supported by buttresses, having
six breaks reaching to the base of the embattled parapet, and
angle pinnacles, with a square-headed west door; on the whole it
is rather heavy.&nbsp; The best external feature of the church is
the clerestory.&nbsp; Internally the nave has six lofty bays with
very slender pillars and a low-pitched roof.&nbsp; It is very
spacious.&nbsp; It has been recently supplied with chairs, and
the old pulpit revived.&nbsp; But for many years the chancel was
the only part used for services, and, indeed, as regards
accommodation, the only part needed.&nbsp; The chancel is
separated from the nave by a very unusual arrangement,&mdash;a
massive stone rood screen, the upper part of which was, some
years ago, used as the singing gallery; and a former old female
verger used to refer, with keen enthusiasm, to the time when,
under the late Mr. Richard Sibthorpe&rsquo;s ministrations (whose
perversions and reversions between Romanism and Anglicanism were,
at the least, remarkable), this gallery reverberated with the
inspiring strains of the fiddle, the trombone, the hautboy, the
clarionet (&ldquo;harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer&rdquo;),
and other kinds of music, to the hearty enjoyment of all.&nbsp;
This massive screen was the gift of a member of the collegiate
body, one Robert de Whalley, in 1528.&nbsp; Little survives of
the original choir but some stalls and sedilia.&nbsp; In the
north transept, removed, for preservation, from their original
positions, are some of the finest brasses in the county; only
half, however, of the once very fine brass of the Treasurer
Cromwell and his wife remains, remarkable for the ape-like
&ldquo;wild men&rdquo; on which his feet rest; and in the course
of years, since Gervase Holles wrote his &ldquo;Notes <!-- page
236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>on
Churches&rdquo; (1642), no less than 14 brasses have disappeared,
and only 7 now remain.&nbsp; Gough, in his account, says that, on
the brass of Maud Willoughby (1497), one of the small figures,
with book and keys, at the side is inscribed &ldquo;Sta
Scytha.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Osyth was the daughter of Frewald, a
Mercian prince, was born at Quarrenden, Bucks., and became the
virgin wife of an East Anglian king.&nbsp; She is a saint not
often mentioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sithe Lane (says Stow the
historian) at the east end of Watling Street, London, is known as
St. Scythe&rsquo;s Lane, so called of St. Sithe&rsquo;s
church.&rdquo; <a name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; The windows of this church were
originally filled with beautiful stained glass of the
Perpendicular period, much of which survived the barbarism of the
Commonwealth, only to be removed by Earl Fortescue in 1757, and
presented to the Earl of Exeter for St. Martin&rsquo;s church in
Stamford, where some of it may still be seen, more or less
damaged by transit.&nbsp; This spoliation so enraged the
parishioners that they, with some justification, raised a riot to
prevent it; and the glass was only, it is said, got away under
cover of night.&nbsp; For 50 years afterwards the windows of the
chancel remained unglazed, and being thus exposed to the weather,
the finely carved oak stalls, rich screens, and other ornamental
work, fell into a state of decay.&nbsp; The chancel was restored
several years ago, and fitted up in a neat, plain manner by the
present Lord Fortescue, at a cost of &pound;800, &pound;1,000
being further spent on the nave.&nbsp; Some very interesting
fragments of the old glass were collected, and they are now
chiefly in the east window.&nbsp; In both transepts are piscinas,
shewing that they were formerly used as chapels.&nbsp; The north
transept was enriched by Edward Hevyn, the agent of Margaret
Countess of Richmond, as was evidenced by &ldquo;a fayre marble
within it,&rdquo; when Holles visited the church, bearing this
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>Have mercy on ye soule, good Lord, we thee pray<br
/>
Of Edward Hevyn, laid here in sepulture.<br />
Which, to their honour, this chappell did array<br />
With ceiling, deske, perclose, portrayture,<br />
And pavement of marble long to endure<br />
Servant of late to the excellent Princess,<br />
Mother of King Henry, of Richmond Countess.</p>

237</span>As this is not intended to be a complete guide to the
church, and all its beauties, but rather to whet the appetite of
the visitor to investigate them further for himself, I shall only
make some detailed remarks upon the brass of Lord Treasurer
Cromwell and his wife, which, while entire, was a fine typical
specimen.&nbsp; A good engraving of it, from a drawing preserved
at Revesby Abbey and made for Sir Joseph Banks, is given in
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Notes &amp; Queries&rdquo; (vol. iii., p.
193); a description is also given there, taken, it would seem,
from the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; of Gervase Holles, as
follows:&mdash;Cromwell, with hands in prayer, is in armour of
plain cuirass, with very short skirt of &lsquo;taces,&rsquo; to
the lower end of which are strapped a pair of
&lsquo;tuiles,&rsquo; or thigh-pieces, pendent over the cuisses
genouillieres, jointed with mail, and having edged plates
fastened to them above and below, long pointed
&lsquo;sollerets&rsquo; of plate armour, and rowell spurs, very
large condieres, cuffed gauntlets of overlapping plates, with
little scales to protect each finger separately; sword hanging
from his waist in front by a strap; over all a mantle, once
thought to be that of the Order of the Garter, but now supposed
to be the official robe of Lord Treasurer, reaching to the ground
behind, and fastened by cords which spring from rose-like
ornaments, with long pendent tasselled ends.&nbsp; The support of
the feet are two &ldquo;Wodehowses,&rdquo; or hairy wild men,
armed with clubs.&nbsp; On the remaining portion of the canopy
pier, on the right, is the figure of St. Peter, in a cope,
wearing the tiara, a key in his left hand and a crozier in the
right, with canopied niche.&nbsp; In another, above, is a figure
of St. Maurice, in armour of the 15th century, in his right hand
a halbert, and in his left a sword.&nbsp; Corresponding with
these, on the left, is a figure of St. George, in similar armour,
thrusting his lance into the dragon&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; Above is
the figure of St. Cornelius, holding a bannered spear in his left
hand, and a sword in his right.&nbsp; The lost saints were on the
right, St. Barbara, St. Hubert, and another, not known; on the
left, St. Thomas of Canterbury, the Virgin, St. John Baptist, St.
Anne with the Virgin kneeling, and a Saint with short spear and
ring, probably Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; Beneath the two wild
men is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>Men rest from their labours, and their works do follow
them.&nbsp; The founder has passed away, and the college also is
no more; and the once richly-endowed benefice is now little
better than a starveling.&nbsp; But the humble Bede-houses,
connected with the college, still remain.</p>
<p>One only further record can we give of Tattershall.&nbsp; Most
places have had their characters.&nbsp; Tradition avers, and not
so long ago either, that a certain worthy farmer, living in the
neighbourhood, used to ride into Tattershall, almost nightly, to
his hostel, to play his game of cards with certain boon
companions.&nbsp; It was before our toll-bars were abolished, and
there stood, near Tattershall bridge, a toll-bar with gate made
formidable by a chevaux de frise of iron spikes.&nbsp; At times
the play ran high, and our friend would return home without a
coin in his pocket wherewith to pay toll.&nbsp; But he was
well-mounted, and on a moonlight night he would not hesitate to
obviate the difficulty by taking the toll-bar at full speed and
landing safely on four legs beyond it.&nbsp; Although I cannot
set my seal to this tradition, yet, from the style in which he
would follow the hounds, I can well believe that not even a
toll-bar, spikes and all, would debar him from his &ldquo;long
clay&rdquo; and glass of wholesome &ldquo;home-brewed&rdquo; by
his own fireside as a &ldquo;night-cap.&rdquo; <a
name="citation238"></a><a href="#footnote238"
class="citation">[238]</a></p>
<p>We now bid adieu to Tattershall, prepared, presumably, to
endorse the verdict of a writer <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>in the
&ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; that the castle is indeed
&ldquo;the finest redbrick tower in the kingdom,&rdquo; <a
name="citation239a"></a><a href="#footnote239a"
class="citation">[239a]</a> and the best example, except,
perhaps, Hurstmonceux, of what good brickwork is capable of in
architecture; and, further, that the church is not unworthy of a
place beside it; and it is not a little remarkable that William
of Waynfleet, who completed it, also built the most beautiful
college in the world, viz., that of Magdalen, Oxford.</p>
<p>Our itinerary is now approaching its conclusion, yet we shall
finish with a <i>bonne bouche</i>.&nbsp; We turn our faces
northward, and, passing by land still called &ldquo;Tattershall
park,&rdquo; though now under cultivation and broken up into
fields; and, where formerly were two ancient encampments, British
or Roman, but now obliterated, a walk of some three miles brings
us in view of a tall fragment of stone-work, two fields distant
on our left.&nbsp; This is the last remaining portion of
Kirkstead Abbey.&nbsp; It is now some 50 feet high and 18 feet,
or so, in width, but an engraving by Buck gives it as at least
double that width; and the writer has conversed with a man whose
father was labouring in the Abbey field when he noticed some
cattle, which had been standing under the shade of the ruin,
suddenly galloping away in alarm, and immediately afterwards a
large portion of the stonework collapsed, and, with a loud crash,
fell to the ground, leaving the relic much about the size which
we see now.</p>
<p>There are mounds and hollows about the Abbey field which show
how extensive the buildings at one time were, covering several
acres; and a canal can be traced which had connection with the
River Witham, which is two fields distant. <a
name="citation239b"></a><a href="#footnote239b"
class="citation">[239b]</a>&nbsp; We here give a brief account of
the Abbey.&nbsp; The manor of Kirkstead was given by the
Conqueror, along with that of Tattershall, as above stated, to
the Norman soldier, Eudo; and his son, Hugh Fitz-Eudo, surnamed
Brito, founded here a Cistercian monastery, in 1139, dedicated to
the Virgin.&nbsp; The Abbey was very richly endowed from more
than one source.&nbsp; The Harleyan MSS. (144) give a full
account of its possessions (29 Henry VIII.).&nbsp; Its lands were
situated in the city of Lincoln, and in Horncastle, <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>Nocton, Blankney, Branston, Metheringham, Canwick,
Sheepwash, Billingham, Thimbleby (where the Abbot had gallows),
Langton, Coningsby, South Langton, Scampton, Holton, Thornton,
Stretton, Wispington, Strutby, Martin, Sudthorpe, Roughton,
Haltham, Benniworth, Hedingley, Woodhall (with the advowson),
Wildmore Fen (45,000 acres), etc., besides property in the
parishes of St. Andrew, Holborn, St. Botolph, Aldersgate, and St.
Nicholas, in the city of London; and the further advowsons of the
benefices of Covenham and Thimbleby.&nbsp; The Abbots exercised
the rights of hunting, fowling and fishing; an old Cartulary of
the Abbey <a name="citation240a"></a><a href="#footnote240a"
class="citation">[240a]</a> states that &ldquo;Robert son of
Simon de Driby . . . grants to the Abbot of Kirkstead to have
their &lsquo;mastiffs&rsquo; in his warren of Tumby all times of
the year, with their shepherds, to take and retake their beasts
in the said warren, without any contradiction of the said Robert
or his heirs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Witness Robert, son of Walter
de Tatessal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The demesne in Wildmore was granted to
the Abbey by Baron Robert Marmyon of Scrivelsby, and William de
Romara, Earl of Lincoln, jointly, on condition that he should not
allow any other parties to pasture on the lands, but only
themselves and their tenants. <a name="citation240b"></a><a
href="#footnote240b" class="citation">[240b]</a>&nbsp; This
William de Romara also founded the Abbey of Revesby in the 8th
year of Stephen, and both to that Abbey and to Kirkstead he
granted a Hermitage in Wildmore; and to show the power of the
Abbots of Kirkstead, it is recorded that when, in course of time,
Ralph de Rhodes, &ldquo;the Lord of Horncastle,&rdquo; succeeded
to the manorial rights in Wildmore, he, contrary to the grants of
his predecessors, &ldquo;did bring in the said Wildmore other
men&rsquo;s cattell&rdquo;; thereupon a plea of covent was sued
against him by the Abbot of Kirkstead, with the result that a
&ldquo;fyne&rdquo; was acknowledged by the said &ldquo;Ralfe de
Rhodes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similarly, a Marmyon, successor of the one
who made the grant, &ldquo;contrary to the graunt of his
ancestors, did bring into Wildmore other men&rsquo;s cattell,
whereupon a like plea of covent was sued against
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in both these cases these secular lords had
to yield to the Abbot.&nbsp; &ldquo;From which time,&rdquo; the
old Record states, &ldquo;the said Abbots have bene Lords of
Wildmore, and peaceably and quietly have enjoyed the same as true
Lords thereof, without impedimte of any man.&rdquo; <a

<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>These successes, however, seem to have elated the
spirit of the Abbots of this monastery, and to have led them, in
the pride of power, not always to have due regard for the rights
of others.&nbsp; As early as the reign of Edward I., it was
complained, before Royal Commissioners, that the Abbot was guilty
of sundry encroachments; that he obstructed passengers on the
King&rsquo;s highway; <a name="citation241a"></a><a
href="#footnote241a" class="citation">[241a]</a> that he made
ditches for his own convenience which flooded his
neighbours&rsquo; lands; and that, from his power, inferior
parties could get no redress; <a name="citation241b"></a><a
href="#footnote241b" class="citation">[241b]</a> that he
prevented the navigation of the Witham by any vessels but his
own; <a name="citation241c"></a><a href="#footnote241c"
class="citation">[241c]</a> that he trespassed on the
King&rsquo;s prerogative by seizing &ldquo;waifs and
strays&rdquo; over the whole of Wildmore; <a
name="citation241d"></a><a href="#footnote241d"
class="citation">[241d]</a> that he had hanged various offenders
at Thimbleby; had appropriated to himself, without licence, the
assize of bread and beer. <a name="citation241e"></a><a
href="#footnote241e" class="citation">[241e]</a>&nbsp; Further,
he refused to pay, on certain lands, the impost called
&ldquo;Sheriff&rsquo;s aid,&rdquo; <a name="citation241f"></a><a
href="#footnote241f" class="citation">[241f]</a> or to do suit
and service for his land, either in the King&rsquo;s Court or
that of the Bishop of Carlisle at Horncastle. <a
name="citation241g"></a><a href="#footnote241g"
class="citation">[241g]</a>&nbsp; Against none of which charges
does it appear that he returned any satisfactory answer.&nbsp;
Yet, while thus acting with a high hand, he was not above worldly
traffic on a considerable scale, as is shewn by certain Patent
Rolls, <a name="citation241h"></a><a href="#footnote241h"
class="citation">[241h]</a> where a note is given to the effect
that, on May 1st, 1285, a licence was granted, at Westminster,
for three years, &ldquo;for the Abbot of Kirkstead to buy wool
throughout the county of Lincoln, in order to satisfy certain
merchants, to whom he is bound in certain sacks of wool, his own
sheep having failed through murrain;&rdquo; while it was further
alleged that he carried on an extensive system of smuggling,
whereby it was calculated that some &pound;2,000 a year were lost
to the corporation of Lincoln.&nbsp; Proceedings like these do
not give us a very favourable impression as to the virtues of
these spiritual lords, their charity, or their standard of
morality.&nbsp; Yet, on the other hand, we have to make allowance
for the times and circumstances in which they lived.&nbsp; I
quote here a letter written by a Lincolnshire man who had viewed
matters from the different standpoints of an Anglican and a
Romanist. <a name="citation241i"></a><a href="#footnote241i"
class="citation">[241i]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>&ldquo;You
say &lsquo;the monks were not saints.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have no
doubt but a small proportion were.&nbsp; Yet, taking them as a
whole, the wonder is they were as respectable as they were.&nbsp;
It is not enough considered what the monastic life was for
several centuries.&nbsp; It was the refuge of hundreds and
thousands who could find no other occupation.&nbsp; There was no
Navy as a profession; the Army was not, in the sense we
understand it, a profession.&nbsp; Law and medicine were very
restricted.&nbsp; What were men to do with themselves?&nbsp; How
to pass life?&nbsp; Where to go to live?&nbsp; There was next to
no education, no books hardly to read.&nbsp; How can we wonder
that the mass of monks were a very common kind of men,
professedly very religious, of necessity formally so, but taking
their duties as lightly as they could?&nbsp; The number of them
who outraged their vows was wonderfully small.&nbsp; The
Inquisitions of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time, atrociously partial, as
they were, to find blame, found comparatively little.&nbsp;
Compare the monks of those days with the Fellows of Colleges in
the last (18th) century, and down almost to our own day.&nbsp;
Were the former much lower in morals, if at all?&nbsp; Less
religious, if at all?&nbsp; I think not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor should
we forget their unbounded hospitality, in an age when there were
few inns for the traveller, and no Poor Law for the destitute;
their skill in horticulture and agriculture, which were a
national benefit; or their maintenance of roads and bridges;
apart from their guardianship of the Scriptures, and their
witness to Christianity.&nbsp; It has been said, &ldquo;From
turret and tower sounded the well-known chime, thrice a day, to
remind the faithful of the Incarnation, and its daily
thrice-repeated memorial&rdquo; (F. G. Lee, &ldquo;Pilgrimage of
Grace&rdquo;).&nbsp; The poor were never forgotten in these
multiplied services.&nbsp; When mass was celebrated, it was a
rule that the sacristan rang the &ldquo;sanctus&rdquo; bell (from
its cherished sanctity often the only bell still preserved in our
village churches), &ldquo;so that the rustics who could not be
present might everywhere, in field or home, be able to bow the
knee to reverence&rdquo; (Maskell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient
Liturgy,&rdquo; p. 95.&nbsp; &ldquo;Constit.,&rdquo; J. Peckham,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1281).&nbsp; If the strict rules
of their continuous services were occasionally relaxed by
exhilarating sport, or even, as the monks of Kirkstead are said
to have done, by frequenting fairs, as at Horncastle, their
abbots presiding at the pastimes of the people, <a
name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242"
class="citation">[242]</a> the Maypole processions <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>and dances; or getting up mystery-plays, or other
exhibitions, perpetuated still at Nuremberg, where our most
cultivated Christians go to witness them; surely these were
comparatively harmless recreations.&nbsp; It must, however, be
recognised that, in time, prosperity had its usual corrupting
effects.&nbsp; The Aukenleck MS. (temp. Ed. II.) says,
&ldquo;these Abbots and Priors do again their rights.&nbsp; They
ride with hawk and hounds, and counterfeit knights.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As the Bishop of Ely attended divine service, leaving his hawk on
its perch in the cloister, where it was stolen, and he solemnly
excommunicated the thief; or as the Bishop of Salisbury was
reprimanded for hunting the King&rsquo;s deer; or as Bishop Juxon
was so keen a sportsman that he was said to have the finest pack
of hounds in the kingdom; <a name="citation243a"></a><a
href="#footnote243a" class="citation">[243a]</a> so the Abbott of
Bardney had his hunting box, and the Abbots of Kirkstead excluded
others from sporting on their demesnes, that they might reserve
the enjoyment for themselves.&nbsp; It is stated by Hallam
(&ldquo;History of the Middle Ages&rdquo;) that, in 1321,
&ldquo;the Archbishop of York carried a train of 200 persons,
maintained at the expense of the monasteries, on his road, and
that he hunted with a pack of hounds, from parish to
parish&rdquo;; and such an example would naturally be
contagious.&nbsp; But it was only when long-continued indulgence
and immunity had pampered them to excess, that laxity of morals
became flagrant or general.&nbsp; And even when of this very
Kirkstead it is recorded that, at the time of the Dissolution,
the Abbot, Richard Haryson (1535) was fain to confess, in the
deed of surrender, that the monks had, &ldquo;under the shadow of
their rule, vainly detestably, and ungodlily devoured their
yearly revenues in continual ingurgitations of their carrion
bodies, and in support of their over voluptuous and carnal
appetites.&rdquo; <a name="citation243b"></a><a
href="#footnote243b" class="citation">[243b]</a>&nbsp; We cannot
but suspect that such language was that of their enemies, put
into their mouths, when resistance was no longer possible.&nbsp;
They had, <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>however, through long ages, acquired
a powerful hold on the respect and affection of the people, and
there were hundreds and thousands who were ready to say, what one
once said of his country,</p>
<blockquote><p>England! with all thy faults, I love thee still.
<a name="citation244a"></a><a href="#footnote244a"
class="citation">[244a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the many virtues and the value of the monasteries came to
be recognised by many after they were abolished is shewn by the
&ldquo;Pilgrimage of Grace,&rdquo; and similar indications of
smouldering discontent among the people whom they had long
benefited.&nbsp; Yet there was always the danger arising from the
perfunctory observance of multiplied services, that the
&ldquo;opus operatum&rdquo; might oust the living faith; and
there can be little doubt that such a result had largely come
about.&nbsp; Though greed and plunder were the main motive of the
Royal Executioner and his agents, the parties who suffered had
certainly become only fitting subjects for drastic
measures.&nbsp; But we pass from this digressive disquisition to
the one interesting relic of Kirkstead Abbey which is still
spared to us, in the little chapel standing in the fields, with
reference to which I will here quote the words of a writer to
whom I have referred before. <a name="citation244b"></a><a
href="#footnote244b" class="citation">[244b]</a>&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;A mile away from Woodhall is one of the loveliest little
gems of architecture in the country, a pure, little, Early
English church, now dreadfully dilapidated, which belonged, in
some unexplained way,&mdash;probably as a chantry
chapel,&mdash;to the Cistercian Abbey of Kirkstead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As this little gem is now locked away from public view, I will
here give extracts from the description of it given by the late
Bishop Suffragan, Dr. Edwd. Trollope, one of our greatest
authorities, on the occasion of the Architectural Society&rsquo;s
visit to it a few years ago; and which was handed to me by him at
the time.&nbsp; They are worthy of careful examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation of this lovely little chapel, on the
south side of the Abbey of Kirkstead, and without its precincts,
is most remarkable.&nbsp; It has been surmised that it may have
served as the Abbot&rsquo;s private chapel, or for the use of the
Abbey tenants; but I can scarcely think that either of these
suggestions is likely to be true, as such a chapel, so far from
the monastic building, and without its protecting girdle, would
not have been convenient for the Abbot&rsquo;s use, and such an
elaborately-ornamented structure <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>would
scarcely have been erected simply for the monastic churls.&nbsp;
Had it been nearer the other buildings, and especially the great
Abbey church, we might have thought it had served as the
Chapter-House, on which much pains was always bestowed by the
Cistercians, so that, in richness of design, this usually ranked
second only to the church itself.&nbsp; I am inclined, however,
to suggest that it was a chantry chapel, put under the protection
of the Abbey and served by its inmates according to the Will of
one of the former wealthy lords of Tattershall and Kirkstead,
whose burial place it eventually became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beautiful little structure consists of an unbroken
oblong, supported by plain buttresses, insufficient to shore up
its side walls and bear the weight of its vaulted roof.&nbsp; A
plain plinth constitutes the footing of the structures, above
which is a bold boutel string, below the window sills, and it is
surmounted by quarter round corbels which originally supported a
corbel table and a higher pitched roof than the present one, not
long ago (in the forties), covered with thatch.&nbsp; The side
windows consist of very narrow little lancets.&nbsp; At the east
end is a triplet, and at the west end structural ornaments of a
most beautiful kind have been most lavishly supplied.&nbsp; Owing
to the loss of the gables of this chapel, and its present hipped
roof, its appearance at a distance does not promise much, but,
when approached, the remarkable beauty of its design, and
especially of its western elevation, will most assuredly command
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From its own architectural evidence we may safely
assume that it was built during the first quarter of the 13th
century, and it nearly resembles the contemporary work in the
north transept of Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp; The western facade is
supported by a buttress on the south, and a larger buttress on
the north in the shape of a staircase turret, the upper portion
of which is now lost.&nbsp; Between these is one of the most
lovely doorways imaginable.&nbsp; Its jambs are first enriched by
an inner pair of pillars, having caps from which spring
vigorously, and yet most delicately, carved foliage; and then,
after a little interval, two more pairs of similar pillars,
carrying a beautifully-moulded arch, one member of which is
enriched with the tooth mould.&nbsp; Above this lovely doorway,
in which still hangs the co-eval, delicately-ironed oak door, is
an arcade of similar work, in the centre of which is a pointed
oval window of beautiful design; but, <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>through the
loss of the gable above, this elevation is sadly marred.&nbsp; In
the north wall, close to the west end, is a semi-circular-headed
doorway, similar in general character to the western one, but
plainer.&nbsp; Its arched head, however, is charmingly moulded,
and has the tooth ornament worked upon its inner chamfer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within, is a still more beautiful sight than without,
for the whole of the interior is, in every respect,
admirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bold, boutel string runs round the walls about five
feet from the ground, and from this, at intervals, rise dwarf
shafts surmounted by most delicately carved caps, the foliation,
of which almost looks as if it might expand, and yield to the
breeze.&nbsp; These serve as supporters to vaulting principals,
enriched with the tooth ornament, dividing the roof vaulting into
four squares, having large circular foliated bosses in the
middle, on the easternmost of which is also carved the holy Lamb
and bannered cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In each bay of the side walls is a pair of lancet
windows, except in the westernmost one of the north wall, where
the north doorway takes the place of one of these, and close to
this, in the west wall, is a little doorway giving access to the
turret staircase.&nbsp; The triplet at the east end is simply
exquisite.&nbsp; This consists of a central lancet and a smaller
one on either side, between which rise lovely clustered and
handed pillars, enriched with flowing foliated caps, supporting,
with the aid of corresponding responds enriched by the tooth
ornament, lovely moulded arches, on which the nail head ornament
is used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towards the east end of the south wall is a piscina,
having a triangular head and shelf groove.&nbsp; Towards the west
end, on the north side, are portions of some very valuable
woodwork, apparently co-eval with the chapel itself.&nbsp; These
probably constituted the lower part of a rood screen, and consist
of slender pillars, supporting lancet-headed arcading.&nbsp; They
are now used as divisions between the seating, and are most
noteworthy. <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a>&nbsp; There is <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>also a
respectable canopied pulpit, of the time of James I., but
scarcely worthy of the worship it seems to invite, from its
peculiar position at the east end of the chapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must now refer more particularly to a sepulchral
effigy in the chapel.&nbsp; The lower portion of this is lost,
and the remainder is now reared up against the south wall.&nbsp;
This represents a knight in a hauberk of mail covered by a
surcoat, and drawing his sword slightly out of its sheath,
pendent on his left.&nbsp; At a low level on the right is his
shield, and over his coife de maille, or mail hood, covering his
head, is a cylindrical helm, slightly convex at the top, having
narrow bands crossing it in front, the horizontal one, which is
wider than the other, or vertical one, being pierced with
ocularia, or vision-slits, but destitute of breathing holes
below.&nbsp; The head, thus doubly protected, rests upon a small
pillow, from which spring branches of conventional foliage.&nbsp;
These helms began to be worn about the opening of the 13th
century; to which breathing holes were added about 1225.&nbsp;
Thus the armour of this knightly effigy exactly coincides in date
with the architecture of the chapel in which it still remains,
and it may well have served to commemorate Robert de Tattershall
and Kirkstead, who died 1212.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To these remarks of the Bishop I here add some valuable
observations made by Mr. Albert Hartshorne, F.S.A., in a Paper
read before the Arch&aelig;ological Institute, <a
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247"
class="citation">[247]</a> and reprinted for private circulation,
on &ldquo;Kirkstead Chapel, and a remarkable monumental effigy
there preserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;Reared against the
south wall at the west end is a monumental effigy in Forest
marble, larger than life, of a man in the military costume of the
first quarter of the 13th century.&nbsp; He wears a cylindrical
helm, a hauberk, apparently hooded, a short surcote, and a broad
cingulum.&nbsp; The left arm is covered by a ponderous shield,
and he draws a sword in a scabbard.&nbsp; He wears breeches of
mail, but the legs, from the knees downward, are missing.&nbsp;
The head rests upon a cushion, supported by conventional
foliage.&nbsp; The occurrence of a cylindrical flat-topped helm
in monumental <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>sculpture is, of itself,
sufficiently rare to merit a notice.&nbsp; There are two examples
of it at Furness Abbey, two at Chester-le-street, one at
Staindrop, and one at Walkern,&mdash;seven only in all, so far as
appears to be known.&nbsp; They occur in the seals of Hen. III.,
Edward I., Alexander II. of Scotland, and Hugh de Vere.&nbsp;
Actual examples of such headpieces are certainly of the utmost
rarity.&nbsp; There is a very genuine one in the Tower, and
another at Warwick Castle.&nbsp; Some sham ones were in the
Helmet and Mail Exhibition, held in the rooms of the Institute in
1880, and are suitably exposed in the illustrated catalogue of
this interesting collection.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Banded
mail,&rdquo; as it is called, has been one of the
arch&aelig;ological difficulties &ldquo;of the past and present
generations, and the late Mr. Burges took great trouble in
endeavouring to unravel the mystery of its construction . . .
having casts made from the only four then known . . . effigies
(with it) at Tewkesbury, Tollard Royal, Bedford, and Newton
Solney; but . . . he had to confess, in the end, that he could
make nothing satisfactory of it.&nbsp; Here, at Kirkstead, is the
fifth known sculptured example of banded mail in the kingdom, and
. . . it is the earliest example of all . . . it resembles most
the Newton Solney type; but I can throw no light upon the
mail&rsquo;s construction, though I have long considered the
subject, and must leave the matter as I found it, twenty years
ago, a mystery.&nbsp; If we are to suppose, as the Bishop
Suffragan has suggested, that a local lord built Kirkstead
chapel, then I am disposed to think, with him, that that lord was
Robert de Tattershall and Kirkstead, who died in 1212.&nbsp; The
date of that chapel may certainly be of about the same period,
namely, a little after the time of St. Hugh of Lincoln, and
co-eval with the Early English work of the second period in
Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp; The effigy may very well have been set
up to the memory of Robert de Tattershall, a few years after his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far the Bishop and Mr. Hartshorne.&nbsp; We have only to
add that, some time in the forties, certain alterations were
made, such as removing the thatched roof and covering it with
slates, taking away much rotten timber and replacing it with
fresh.&nbsp; Some so-called &ldquo;unsightly beams&rdquo; were
also removed, but they had probably been introduced at a very
early period, and it was, probably, also mainly due to them that
the walls had not fallen further outward than they had
done.&nbsp; Whereas now, without any such support, and with the
massive stone roof <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>pressing upon them, the destruction
of the building must be only a question of time, and that not a
very long one, unless some remedy is applied.&nbsp; I have a
note, from Baron Hubner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Travels through the
British Empire,&rdquo; <a name="citation249"></a><a
href="#footnote249" class="citation">[249]</a> that &ldquo;when
the town of Melbourne, in Australia, in 1836, was yet a small
scattered village, with wooden houses, wooden church, &amp;c., a
tree was the belfry.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that same period the bell of
Kirkstead chapel also hung in a tree, still standing at the
south-west corner of the churchyard.&nbsp; Climbing up, a few
years ago, to examine the bell, I found the following, cut in the
lead under the bell turret: &ldquo;Thomas Munsall, Nottingham,
August, 1849; Edward Gadsby, Nottingham, Aug., 1849.&nbsp; George
Whitworth (of Kirkstead), Joiner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two former
slated the roof, and the last was the local carpenter.&nbsp; The
history of this church in modern times, as a place of worship,
has bean peculiar.&nbsp; The estate, having been bestowed upon
the Fiennes Clintons by Henry VIII., passed, in the 18th century,
by marriage, to the Disneys and the benefice, being a Donative
and, therefore, almost private property, Mr. Daniel Disney, being
a Presbyterian, appointed a minister of that persuasion to
officiate; also endowing it with lands which produced a stipend
of &pound;30 a year in 1720.&nbsp; This gift was confirmed by his
Will.&nbsp; Presbyterian ministers continued to hold it till the
death of a Mr. Dunkley in 1794.&nbsp; The manor had then been
sold to the Ellison family, and a suit was instituted to recover
the benefice to the Church of England; the case was tried at
Lincoln Assizes in 1812, when, by a compromise, the fabric was
restored to the Church of England; but the Presbyterian endowment
remained in the hands of trustees, who subsequently erected a
Presbyterian chapel at Kirkstead, and in more recent times, a
manse was built in connection with it, now occupied by the Rev.
R. Holden.&nbsp; Dr. John Taylor, of Norwich, was one of the
ministers appointed by Mr. Disney.&nbsp; He held it some 18
years, from 1715, and here composed his Concordance, in 2
vols.&nbsp; In 1876 the church was visited by the Architectural
Society, when, in consequence of its dangerous condition, it was
closed by order of the Bishop, awaiting restoration, and it
awaits it still.</p>
<p>Of this interesting structure no one can get any view of the
interior beyond (strange to say) what can be seen through the
keyhole.&nbsp; May we hope that the Rontgen Rays may soon be
sufficiently <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>developed to enable us to photograph
it through the boards of the ancient door, the hinges of which,
we may add, are worthy of notice.&nbsp; I conclude these remarks
upon it with the words of a former owner, <a
name="citation250a"></a><a href="#footnote250a"
class="citation">[250a]</a> who was inspired to write of it
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This ancient chanel!&nbsp; Still the House of
God,<br />
And boasting still the consecrated sod,<br />
&rsquo;Neath which, where ancient oaks, wide-spreading, shade,<br
/>
The rude forefathers of the place were laid.<br />
Fair, too, as ancient, is that holy place,<br />
Its walls and windows richest traceries grace;<br />
While clusters of the lightest columns rise,<br />
And beauties all unlooked for, there surprise.<br />
&rsquo;Twas well, when Ruin smote the neighbouring Pile,<br />
It spared this humbler Beauty to defile.<br />
. . . . . . . . .<br />
O!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a gem of purest taste, I ween,<br />
Though little it be known, and seldom seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer may add that he has himself twice made strenuous
efforts, backed most earnestly by the late Bishop Wordsworth, and
has sent out many hundreds of appeals for aid, to prevent this
little gem going to ruin; but, owing to apathy and indifference,
where they should not have been found, those efforts proved
futile.&nbsp; He can only reiterate the warning words of Mr.
Albert Hartshorne:&mdash;&ldquo;I know not whether such aid will
be forthcoming; but of two things I am quite certain: if nothing
is done the chapel must collapse, and that very soon; and when it
does so fall, it will become such an utter ruin that it would be
quite impossible to put it up again.&rdquo; <a
name="citation250b"></a><a href="#footnote250b"
class="citation">[250b]</a></p>
<p>One more historical incident, of more than local interest, may
here just be mentioned.&nbsp; It has already been stated that
after the Dissolution the Abbey lands were granted by Henry VIII.
to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and that, on the death of
his issue the King granted them to the Fiennes Clinton family, in
the person of Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl of
Lincoln.&nbsp; In this family they remained for several
generations, until by marriage they passed to the Disneys.&nbsp;
In the time of the unhappy King Charles I., families were often
divided, one party remaining true to the Sovereign, and a
relative espousing the cause of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; But Henry
Clinton, alias Fynes, remained staunch to his King, providing
horse and arms for the Royalist cause.&nbsp; This, no doubt,
brought him not a few enemies; and in <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>consequence
he had the great compliment paid him of being granted a deed of
&ldquo;Protection&rdquo; by his grateful sovereign.&nbsp; We
cannot give the whole here, but it is entitled &ldquo;Protection
of Mr. Henry Fynes &amp; his Wyfe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Endorsed) by Major Markham of ye Lyfeguards,&rdquo;
and is headed &ldquo;Charles R . . . whereas Wee are informed
that Henry Fynes of Christed Abbey . . . and his wyfe are, and
have been, in all these rebellious times, persons very loyall and
well affected to us and our service, wee are graciously pleased
to grant them this our speciall Protection, &amp;c., &amp;c. . .
. given at our Court at Oxford ye 7th day of February,
1643.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fac-simile copy of the original is given in
&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo; vol. i. (1889), p. 22.</p>
<p>To any of his kith and kin who may still be living among us,
and they are not few, it may be a pleasure and a pride to reflect
that their ancestor &ldquo;of Christed&rdquo; shewed himself a
true man in times when it needed some courage to do so.&nbsp;
None of them could have a better motto to abide by, in all
things, than that of the head of the House, &ldquo;Loyalt&egrave;
n&rsquo;a honte,&rdquo; Loyalty is not ashamed.</p>
<p>Our lengthy peregrinations have now brought us, once more,
within a mile of Woodhall Spa; thither let us proceed,
&ldquo;rest and be thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And now, gentle readers, it would seem we have arrived at a
fitting &ldquo;period, or full stop,&rdquo; in our somewhat
arduous undertaking; and here we might well shake hands and
finally part company,&mdash;we would fain hope, with a hearty
&ldquo;au revoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find myself much in the mood of the Alpine guide who feels
that he has had more than one long day with his trusty
alpenstock, although with a willing heart in the work, and, we
might say, even proud that he has been able to show his party
through so many attractive scenes.&nbsp; He stands, as it were,
before them, hat in hand <a name="citation251"></a><a
href="#footnote251" class="citation">[251]</a> awaiting the
&ldquo;pour boire,&rdquo; the due recompense of his
services.&nbsp; Freely he has given, freely he hopes to receive,
that he may retire to his quiet ch&acirc;let on the hill, where
he may rest awhile, till perchance he finds a fresh
engagement.&nbsp; But, at this juncture, he is accosted by one of
the party to this effect: &ldquo;Mon cher Guide Walder, you have
taken us through more than one enjoyable round in your <!-- page
252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>interesting country.&nbsp; We have looked with pleasure
upon many a long vista in the past, and on many a wide-spreading
prospect of varied character.&nbsp; You have, indeed, given us a
bonne-bouche, to finish with, in Kirkstead, but we would ask,
&lsquo;Why have you omitted Somersby, Somersby not so very far
away, and hallowed as the birth-place of the Bard of the Century,
who is reckoned as one of the High Priests of Poesy, wherever our
English tongue is spoken?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; We confess the
omission.&nbsp; Our apology is, that our excursions have already,
in the more immediate neighbourhood, been only too long.&nbsp; As
to Somersby, as its associations are <i>sui generis</i>, so it
lies in a direction of its own; not easily to be combined with
other places of interest; but the fault can be remedied.&nbsp;
Quid multa?&nbsp; A short supplementary excursion is arranged;
and we are to muster on the morrow for the last, but not least,
of our Looks at Lincolnshire.</p>
<h2>SUPPLEMENTARY.</h2>
<p>In the year 1890, an enthusiastic Tennysonian, giving an
account in the &ldquo;Globe&rdquo; newspaper, of an excursion to
Somersby, which he approached from Louth, says that he was
somewhat disgusted to find that his Jehu, though familiar with
every ragamuffin on the road, and with the gossip and traditions
of the villages through which they passed, had never heard the
name of Tennyson.&nbsp; Somersby itself, at the time when
Tennyson there enjoyed ramble and reverie, was so withdrawn from
the outer world that it is said that the battle of Waterloo was
not heard of there until a month after it had been fought.&nbsp;
But all this has now been changed, and is changing.&nbsp; Not
long ago, the proprietor of Somersby (now, alas! an absentee),
complained to the writer that his carpets were being worn into
holes by the feet of the many pilgrims to this modern poetic
&ldquo;Mecca,&rdquo; who seemed to think they had a right freely
to intrude everywhere; with the barren compensation to himself
that his paternal home was becoming historical.&nbsp;
Sympathising fully with the country squire whose privacy has been
thus invaded, we are now ourselves about to make the pilgrimage,
which may soon be as common as that to the birthplace of the
immortal Bard of Avon.</p>
<p>Having arrived at Horncastle by train, or otherwise, we pass
through the town, by Market-place, Bull Ring, and over the far
bridge, where we turn due eastward, by East street.&nbsp; At the
end of a mile <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>or so we arrive at High Toynton,
with a modern church of Spilsby sandstone on our right, in good
condition, but of no special interest; here we turn to the left,
and 100 yards further on, again eastward to the right.&nbsp; We
are now on the Wolds, and have before us a steady rise, followed
by three steepish descents with their corresponding rises, till,
as we approach Holbeck Hall, we see before us, to the left, a
hill in the shape of an obtuse truncated cone.&nbsp; This is Hoe
Hill (Norse &lsquo;hof,&rsquo; holy and so possibly a sacred
place for heathen worship; or, the Norse &lsquo;haugr&rsquo; or
&lsquo;howe,&rsquo; a burial place, possibly the resting-place of
some Viking chief, the names all round having Danish
elements).&nbsp; It has a Dyke, or scarpment, running round it,
like a collar, and was probably a British or Danish encampment;
geologically it consists of ironstone, quite distinct from the
sandstone formation on the lower ground.&nbsp; At Holbeck it is
worth the while to turn in at the Lodge gate, and proceed some
250 yards along the drive, when we find ourselves among very
pretty scenery; the modern Hall confronting us, built by the late
J. Fardell, Esq., who was M.P. for Lincoln for about a
week.&nbsp; We pause in a woody dell with a picturesque lake and
rocks on each side of us.&nbsp; (N.B.&mdash;In these rocks the
badger still survives).&nbsp; Retracing our steps into the main
road again, and some 200 yards back towards Horncastle, by a
guide-post the road turns off southward, and, following this, we
arrive at Ashby Puerorum, or Ashby &ldquo;of the boys,&rdquo; so
called to distinguish it from the other two Ashbys, not far off,
the name being derived from the fact that certain lands in the
parish are appropriated to the maintenance of the choristers of
Lincoln Cathedral, the Dean and Chapter being patrons of the
benefice.&nbsp; The road here is somewhat tortuous, but we find
our way to the church, the chancel of which was restored by the
patrons in 1869, and the rest of the building in 1877.&nbsp; It
is a small fabric, consisting of nave, north aisle, chancel,
small porch, and western tower.&nbsp; The main building is Early
English.&nbsp; A lancet window still remains in the south wall,
and at the west end of the aisle.&nbsp; The other windows of the
nave are mostly Perpendicular.&nbsp; On the south side of the
chancel is a two-light, square-headed, decorated window.&nbsp;
The arcade has two chamfered arches, on low cylindrical
piers.&nbsp; The tower is a low, stunted example of
Perpendicular, the green sandstone picturesquely patched with
brick.&nbsp; The west doorway is well proportioned, and the
three-light Perpendicular window above, and the tower arch, are
plain but good.&nbsp; There is <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>a plain
octagonal font.&nbsp; On the south wall is a brass to Richard
Littlebury, of Stainsby, in the parish (obiit 1521); his wife
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Jenny, of Suffolk (died 1523);
and their ten children.&nbsp; The brass, according to Haines, was
not cut till 1560, at the same time with another of a knight in
armour, now without inscription, but probably one of the six sons
of the above.&nbsp; In the pavement is a the incised slab of blue
marble, representing a priest in Eucharistic vestments, with
chalice on the breast.&nbsp; The head, hands, chalice, and other
portions were of brass, but these have disappeared.&nbsp; As has
been elsewhere stated, in 1794, a Roman sepulchre was discovered
three feet below the surface,&mdash;a stone chest, containing an
urn of strong glass of greenish hue.&nbsp; The urn held small
pieces of calcined bone, and, among them, a small lacrimatory of
very thin green glass.&nbsp; Sir Joseph Banks thought it not
improbable that, some day, the site of a Roman villa might be
found near at hand. <a name="citation254"></a><a
href="#footnote254" class="citation">[254]</a></p>
<p>We again take to the main road, due eastward, and at the
distance of another mile or so, we arrive at a steep descent,
embowered in lofty trees; and, at the foot of this, &ldquo;The
Brook,&rdquo; immortalized by the Laureate, winds its musical way
beneath the road, under a bridge.&nbsp; To the left we see its
course (where the writer has ofttimes &ldquo;tickled&rdquo; his
trout), through a green meadow, as it issues from the wood named
&ldquo;Holy Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the right it speeds onward
through low-lying lands until it is lost in the distance.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the narrow lane,&mdash;so narrow, indeed,
that only at certain points can two vehicles pass each other, and
shut in by banks of sandstone,&mdash;we reach, on the right, a
well in the rock, the latter green and grey with moss, lichen and
fern, the water clear as crystal.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a lonely,
quiet spot, fit place for musing meditation, in a poet&rsquo;s
wanderings.&nbsp; Just a cottage or two to remind one that there
is a population, but not obtrusive.&nbsp; The rectory is the
second, and larger, of two houses on the right, though now
occupied as a farmhouse.&nbsp; It is a quaint, unpretending,
old-time residence, uniting manor house and rectory in one.&nbsp;
At its eastern end is a semi-ecclesiastical addition, with
pointed windows having coloured glass of no particular
merit.&nbsp; In the ground-floor apartment in this is a carved
mantlepiece, the work of the Laureate&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; Just
beyond is a brick castellated building, &ldquo;The <!-- page
255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Grange,&rdquo; said to have been designed by
Vanbrugh.&nbsp; Its construction is massive, and its curious
cellars and other details make it something of a &ldquo;Romance
in brick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly it is a fair example of that
solid style of building which gave rise to his (suggested)
epitaph,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Lie heavy on him, Earth; for he<br />
Laid many a heavy weight on thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can hardly help feeling that it must have been a reduction
from some original, more ambitious, design; and those gloomy
cellars may well have harboured the smuggler, or his illicit
hoards, in days when not only humbler boards, but the table of
parson and squire, boasted unblushingly of the
&ldquo;Schiedam&rdquo; which had not paid duty, and was thought
the better of it.&nbsp; This house is the reputed home of
Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Northern Farmer,&rdquo; whose dialect,
however, as given by the poet, is generally considered by
experts, however picturesque, to be considerably overdrawn. <a
name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255"
class="citation">[255]</a>&nbsp; In Somersby itself, except for
its secluded beauty, there would be little to interest the
visitor were it not for its association with the early years of
the Tennysons.&nbsp; And one of the present writer&rsquo;s
earliest recollections is, as a small boy, driving his sisters,
in a donkey cart through the village; when they were accosted by
two strollers on the road, one of whom was Alfred Tennyson, then
on a visit to the rectory, and not yet Laureate.</p>
<p>The Church of Somersby has little of interest, beyond a small
brass with kneeling figure of George Littlebury, dated 1612; a
stoup in the porch, and over the porch a sundial, with the legend
&ldquo;Time passeth,&rdquo; dated 1751.&nbsp; The tower, however,
has two good medi&aelig;val bells.&nbsp; In repairing the tower
in 1883, a fine window in its western face was removed and
replaced by an inferior one (Saunders &ldquo;Hist.,&rdquo; vol.
ii., p. 173).&nbsp; The modern restoration, with bright tiling of
the floor, gives a brand-new appearance, rather out of keeping
with the almost crumbling low tower, and rustic
surroundings.&nbsp; The one really interesting feature is the
churchyard cross.&nbsp; It is of Perpendicular date, tall, well
designed, and with octagonal shaft gracefully tapering from the
base to a corona, and having above that a cross, which, possibly
owing to the very retired position of the village, has escaped
the iconoclast.&nbsp; It has, on one side, the Crucifixion, and
on the other the Virgin and Infant Saviour.&nbsp; It is almost
unique in its very good <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>state of
preservation, the Puritans having generally ruthlessly mutilated
such erections.&nbsp; Several models of it, in bronze, were made
some years ago to the order of the late Mr. C. J. Caswell, and
were speedily sold off as memorials of Tennyson.&nbsp; It has
also recently been reproduced in the churchyard of Huttoft, in
this county, where the church was restored, in 1895, by Mr. W.
Scorer, architect, of Lincoln.</p>
<p>One of the places visited should be Holy Well wood.&nbsp; It
is a leafy dell, where tower up lofty trees still vigorous, while
others are lying rotting on the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nature in her old wild way,<br />
Life blending closely with decay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thin stream twines about their roots, or springs over
sandstone bars, in sylvan, solitude.&nbsp; The spot was
described, years ago, by Howitt in his &ldquo;Homes and Haunts of
English Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; A local authority says that, once
upon a time, a series of steps led down to the well, where an
upright post was fixed, and a cross-bar from it was secured to
the rock.&nbsp; On this cross-bar was an iron ring and a cable,
by which a bather could let himself down for a dip in the well;
and an old servant of the Tennyson family could remember when
numbers of people came to take the water, which was considered to
have health-giving properties. <a name="citation256"></a><a
href="#footnote256" class="citation">[256]</a></p>
<p>The manor of Somersby goes with that of Bag Enderby, and the
benefices are held together, being barely a mile apart.&nbsp; The
church of the latter is rather more interesting than that of
Somersby, and it would be a pity not to see it, while we are so
far, or near.&nbsp; It was built by Albin de Enderby, who died in
1407.&nbsp; Some of the windows, as the three-light one at the
east end of the chancel, and others are Perpendicular; while
others are of the Decorated style, but probably of the same
date.&nbsp; There is some interesting old iron-work on the
original oak door in the porch.&nbsp; The font is octangular,
Perpendicular; on the bowl is carved the figure of the Virgin,
supporting on her knees the dead body of the Saviour; a shield,
on which is cut the spear, and hyssop with sponge, crosswise; the
cross and crown of thorns; a deer couchant with head turned back,
and feeding on the leaves of a tree; and other more ordinary
devices.&nbsp; The chancel arch is fine, and there are some
remains of a screen.&nbsp; All the windows would <!-- page
257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>seem to have been originally filled with
delicately-painted 14th century glass, of which fragments
retrain.&nbsp; In the westernmost window of the south wall of the
nave is a shield bearing the arms of Croyland Abbey.&nbsp; In the
central alley of the nave are two fine Purbeck marble slabs,
bearing legends on brass plates. <a name="citation257"></a><a
href="#footnote257" class="citation">[257]</a>&nbsp; On the north
wall of the chancel is a stone mural monument commemorating
Andrew and Dorothy Gedney, with their two sons and two daughters,
kneeling before two prayer-desks, in the costume of their
period.&nbsp; In the churchyard is the base of a cross, the upper
part having been removed some years ago.&nbsp; The font stands on
a sepulchral slab, which has been ruthlessly cut into for the
purpose.</p>
<p>As the name Enderby is sometimes, in old documents, written
Hinterby, an idea has been broached that the prefix
&ldquo;Bag,&rdquo; means &ldquo;back,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;hinder-by.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, as we are in the region of
sand and sandstone, abounding in burrows, it would seem more
likely that the Bag is the badger; after a similar form to
Bagshot, in Surrey, <i>i.e.</i>, Bag or Badger&rsquo;s holt;
Bagley, near Oxford; Badgeworth, near Cheltenham (from which last
neighbourhood the writer has a badger-skin), &amp;c.&nbsp; An
alternative derivation, of course, is the word Bag, or Bage,
<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;turf,&rdquo; for fuel, which might be not
unlikely in Lincolnshire; but as &ldquo;Bag&rdquo; enters into
place-names all over the kingdom, where the word
&ldquo;Bag,&rdquo; for turf, is not used, this is hardly a likely
explanation.</p>
<p>A short extension of our travels eastwards, through pretty
scenery, with bold rising ground&mdash;Somersby Top, Warden Hill,
&amp;c.&mdash;capped by woods, brings us to Harrington, where we
find an interesting old mansion belonging to Sir H. D. Ingilby,
built in the reign of James II. with old-time garden, having
parterres and terraces and extensive lawns, but, unfortunately,
not at present occupied, and much decayed.&nbsp; There is a very
interesting church, almost entirely rebuilt by the late Rector,
Rev. R. W. Cracroft, in 1855, but retaining a series of fine
monuments of his own connections, the Knightly family of the
Coppledykes; <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the earliest of these, Sir John de
Harrington, temp. Edward I., was a Crusader.&nbsp; His effigy
lies on an altar tomb, beneath an arch in the south wall, at the
east end of the nave.&nbsp; He is in complete armour,
cross-legged, his hands joined in prayer.&nbsp; The next is a
slab in the chancel floor, once having brass effigies, but which,
with the inscription, have been removed.&nbsp; It commemorated
John Coppledyke and his wife Margaret Tilney, and bore date
1480.&nbsp; Her effigy is now affixed to the wall of the
chancel.&nbsp; The third is that of John Coppledyke, who died in
1552.&nbsp; Then there is the recessed altar-tomb of his son,
also John, who died in 1585.&nbsp; It is in the Tudor style,
altar and canopy all of Purbeck marble.&nbsp; Opposite is the
monument of his brother Francis and his wife, the former dying in
1590.&nbsp; Then come tombs of the Elizabethan and Jacobean
period.&nbsp; This typical series closes with the tomb of Thomas,
the nephew of Francis, described in the epitaph as &ldquo;the
last and best of his race.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tower and font are
the originals preserved; the latter bears on one of its faces the
arms of Tilney impaling Coppledyke, shewing that it was the joint
gift of John and Margaret, towards the end of the fifteenth
century.</p>
<p>We have taken these latter two churches because they lie
within easy reach from Somersby, the main object of our
excursion, and they add to its interest.&nbsp; We now turn
homewards again, but by a different route.&nbsp; We might, from
Somersby, have visited Salmonby, barely a mile away, where there
is a restored church with some interesting features; and we might
also have included a visit to Tetford, a large village or small
town, equi-distant from Somersby, with a fairly large church, but
in a very bad condition and much needing careful
restoration.&nbsp; But these we are constrained to omit, as the
day&rsquo;s excursion is to be a short one.&nbsp; From
Harrington, we turn south-west, and climb a hill of some mile in
extent, to the pleasant village of Hagworthingham, where we find
a model church, beautifully situated.&nbsp; It has been largely
rebuilt, but retains some ancient features, which show that the
structure was originally Early English.&nbsp; This style has been
retained.&nbsp; The church has nave, chancel, south aisle, tower
and south porch.&nbsp; The arcade is of four bays, with arches
rising from low cylindrical piers, with moulded capitals, earlier
than the arches which they support.&nbsp; These low arches give a
kind of &ldquo;dim religious light&rdquo; to <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>the
fabric.&nbsp; The antiquarian, Gervase Holles, says <a
name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a> of this church: &ldquo;On a gravestone
of blue marble, in ye body of ye Church is pourtrayed in brasse
one in compleat armour, bearing upon ye manches of his coate of
armes on either side 2 crescents.&nbsp; Between his feet a right
hand couped.&nbsp; The rest is defaced.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
present time the whole of this is gone.&nbsp; The font has a
plain octagonal basin, supported by a group of Early English
shafts.&nbsp; The tower is low and square, its greenish sandstone
being relieved by an intermixture of brick, and has a good peal
of bells.&nbsp; The church is well cared for in every way, and
its position perfect.&nbsp; Three-quarters of a mile south there
is a very interesting church at Lusby, but, although some of its
peculiar features would well repay a visit, it is slightly out of
our beat, and we must draw the line somewhere.&nbsp; We have
between four and five miles of steep hills and valleys between us
and Horncastle, a route which cannot be hurried over, and we must
push on.&nbsp; From Greetham Hill, on a clear day, we command a
view across the Wash, into Norfolk, to our left, while to our
right we again see towering up, 25 miles away, the mass of
Lincoln Minster.</p>
<p>The peculiar feature of this supplementary excursion is that
it affords a revelation to those strangers to Lincolnshire who
imagine the county to be flat as a billiard table.&nbsp; We have
been truly travelling, as was said by a Dutch sportsman, 300
years ago (whom I have quoted in a previous chapter), in
&ldquo;Lincolniensi montium tractu&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fuller&rsquo;s
Worthies,&rdquo; p. 150), &ldquo;among the mountains of
Lincolnshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we bring our Records and excursions to a close.&nbsp;
Like Vikings of old (under a figure) we have harried the country
round, and (in a sense) ravished its many charms.&nbsp; We have
explored shrines consecrated by olden memories, enriched by the
associations of centuries; but (unlike the Vikings), we have done
this in no irreverent spirit, and with no predatory
purpose.&nbsp; We have carried off our hoards of treasure, but we
have left no ill traces behind us of our raid.&nbsp; No burning
monasteries or homesteads have marked our track; no orphaned
children or widowed wives follow us with their execrations.&nbsp;
Enriching ourselves, we have not impoverished others, and the
country is still open for further investigation, with, doubtless,
many a nook yet unexplored, and many a mushy folio unopened,
whence others may extract materials of <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>further
interest.&nbsp; On the whole we trust that our readers will
endorse the words of a Lincolnshire man whom we have already
quoted more than once, <a name="citation260"></a><a
href="#footnote260" class="citation">[260]</a> that, although
ours may be &ldquo;a county which few have defended, still fewer
have praised, and too many have depreciated&rdquo;; yet that it
does possess many objects and associations of no small interest,
and that not the least of these are to be found in the Records of
Woodhall Spa, and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>This is hardly the place to moralise, nor have we space to do
so to more than a very limited extent; yet two reflections seem
to force themselves upon us as the result of the
arch&aelig;ological enquiries which have produced the last three
chapters of this work.&nbsp; One of these is the evil
consequences of a barren formalism in religion.&nbsp; The monkish
perfunctory services, with their &ldquo;vain repetitions&rdquo;
and &ldquo;long players,&rdquo; reduced the individual well-nigh
to the level of a praying machine, which could run off, as it
were, from the reel, so many litanies in a given time, with
little effort of intellect, and only a blind exercise of faith;
both fatal to religious vitality.&nbsp; The dissolution of the
monasteries, which were, perhaps, more abundant in our own
neighbourhood than in any other similarly limited area in the
kingdom, is not only a fact in history, but also may be an
object-lesson in a different age.&nbsp; At the close of the
enlightened 19th century we witnessed a church&mdash;may I not
almost say, a nation?&mdash;convulsed over questions of religious
ceremonial, which, to minds endeavouring to take a sober and
unbiassed view, seem bordering on the puerile, compared with the
weightier matter of the religion of heart and life.&nbsp; We can
hardly help exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, that practical Englishmen
would spend their energies on larger issues rather than thus give
a handle to their enemies!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is such a thing as
&ldquo;having the form of godliness without the indwelling power
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; From such let us turn away, or history may,
even yet, repeat itself.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the plunder of the monasteries was
primarily, though not avowedly, caused by the greed of a master
mind, in Wolsey&mdash;whose extravagance needed &ldquo;the sinews
of war,&rdquo; acting upon a desire for revenge, deeply seated in
the heart of a Sovereign, self-convicted we may well believe, but
stubbornly clinging to <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>his sin;
whose unjustifiable act, in the divorce of Catherine of Aragon,
outraged the national sense of right, but especially was
condemned by the religious orders.&nbsp; Yet, none the less,
though brought about by unworthy motives, and the result, as it
were, of side issues, the destruction of those institutions, with
all their virtues and their manifold usefulness, coincided with a
condition of things, widely prevalent, which rendered them only
&ldquo;fit for the burning.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had, indeed, served
their generation, and more than one, but they had become
&ldquo;carrion&rdquo; in the nostrils, and, &ldquo;where the
carcase&rdquo; was, &ldquo;the vultures&rdquo; of retribution,
almost in the natural order of events, were &ldquo;gathered
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second reflection tends in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>A reactionary sentiment of our day is to make an idol of the
great figure-head of Puritanism.&nbsp; We had lately (April 25,
1899) a celebration of the Tercentenary of Cromwell; in the place
of his birth he has been made use of (by a strange stroke of
irony) as an apostle of education.&nbsp; Projects are on foot for
erecting his statue in positions of honour.&nbsp; Yet we see
still in our own neighbourhood, as well as elsewhere, traces of
the almost universal desecration of our holy places perpetrated
by the fanaticism which he fostered and guided.&nbsp; Was Henry
VIII. an Iconoclast, in shattering the monasteries?&nbsp; No less
was the crime of Puritanism in dismantling our churches and
stripping them of treasures which were beyond price.&nbsp; The
antiquarian Carter says, &ldquo;Before the hand of destruction
wrought such fatal devastation, every sacred edifice throughout
England, whether of confined or extended dimensions, teemed with
a full and resplendent show of painted glass, all equally
excellent, all equally meritorious&rdquo; (Remarks on York
Minster, Winkle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cathedrals,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 54,
n. 30).&nbsp; In confirmation of this I take two instances: Four
miles away we have the fine Church of Coningsby, and we have in
these pages (pp. 222&ndash;226) a detailed description of the
splendid series of coloured windows which formerly adorned that
church.&nbsp; We ask, &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; and echo
can only reiterate &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&nbsp; But for Gervase
Holles, a Lincolnshire man and formerly M.P. for Grimsby, we
should not now know that they ever existed.&nbsp; We take another
case, one of the humblest structures in our neighbourhood, the
church of Langton, and we have records given by <!-- page
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>the same authority of windows once existing here whose
blazonry connected it with the ancient families of Everingham, de
Seyrt, Skipwith, Bec, Ufford, and Willoughby.&nbsp; Where are
they now?&nbsp; The wave of Puritanism has swept away every trace
of them.&nbsp; Somersby indeed retains its churchyard cross,
almost an isolated instance.&nbsp; The Puritan axe and hammer
missed it, no thanks to them.&nbsp; The beautifully-carved
fragments of destroyed monasteries, preserved perhaps as relics
on our garden rockeries warn us of the dangers of mere formalism
in religion.&nbsp; The Puritan spoliation of our holy places
warns us against fanaticism and irreverence.&nbsp; Turn neither
to the right hand nor to the left.&nbsp; In medio tutissimus
ibis.&nbsp; We may well &ldquo;hark back&rdquo; to the devotion
of our forefathers, but from either extreme, Domine, dirige
nos.</p>
<p>And now there only remains the duty, or, rather, the
privilege, of saying one parting word more.&nbsp; A Preface may
be called a pre-post-erous production, because, though standing
at the head of a book, it is almost invariably written after the
book is finished, and when the author can take a general review
of his work.&nbsp; In the present instance this was
impossible.&nbsp; The exigencies of the situation&mdash;these
Records first appearing as a weekly series in &ldquo;The
Horncastle News&rdquo;&mdash;required that the Introduction, to
stand at their head, should be written when the work itself was
yet only an embryo conceived in the writer&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp;
He may truly be said to have begun <i>ab ovo</i>.&nbsp; He knew,
indeed, generally, his own intentions, but he could not possibly,
as yet, tell the exact form in which they would be embodied, and,
as an unavoidable consequence, in the present case, as in not a
few others, what should naturally be the head is here found where
the tail should be.&nbsp; The real Preface closes, instead of
introducing, the writer&rsquo;s work to his readers.</p>
<p>A general outline, indeed, of the work had been laid down on
paper more than a dozen years ago.&nbsp; During that interval (as
also for several years before it) the materials had been
accumulating; but still, when the work actually began to take
shape, the writer was standing, as it were, at one end of a coil,
of which he could not see the other; the windlass was letting
down a chain into depths which his eye could not penetrate, nor
his knowledge yet reach.</p>
<p>The outline originally sketched out has really in one only
particular been departed from, but, in the process of its
evolution, the thread has <!-- page 263--><a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>considerably stretched.&nbsp; The Clotho of its destiny
has spun a longer web than had been foreseen by the writer.&nbsp;
On coming to closer quarters with his subject, materials
multiplied beyond his expectations, and but for the pruning
knife, the result would have been still larger than it is.</p>
<p>How much the author is indebted to the previous industry of
others is shewn by the number of the footnotes, and other
references in the text, which together amount to close upon five
hundred.&nbsp; Others have laboured and he has entered into their
labours, and his object, in this, as it were, post-prandial
utterance, is to own, with gratitude, the varied
viands&mdash;epul&aelig; lautissim&aelig;&mdash;which he has
found spread before him.&nbsp; He would say, with Cicero, opipare
epulati sumus; and yet there are many baskets of fragments
left.</p>
<p>He would also here express his thanks for the unvaried
kindness with which his personal visits, in search of local
information, have been welcomed; for the helpful response always
made to his enquiries; as well as for the sympathy shewn towards
his undertaking.&nbsp; But for these the work could not have
attained its present dimensions, nor could much of its most
interesting matter have been obtained; while, further they have
made the work a task of real pleasure to himself.&nbsp; He can
only say, in conclusion that if others should find, in the
perusal of these pages, even a tithe of the entertainment which
he has himself found in the compilation of them, he will be more
than satisfied&mdash;gratified&mdash;by the result.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The Langton here named is Langton St. Andrew, now
synonymous with Woodhall Spa, but referring specially to the
ground west of the Stixwould Road, though including
Jordan&rsquo;s Pond.&nbsp; All these fossils may be expected
throughout the immediate neighbourhood, in Kirkstead, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., as they are all from the Kimeridge formation.</p>
<p>We have no list of fossils from the lower geological
formations, which are out of ordinary reach.&nbsp; Those here
given are near the surface, or exposed in ditches or pits, and
may be found by anyone who has the eye to discern them.</p>

ominously as it sat on the bough of a tree hard by, and that it
distinctly uttered these words, &ldquo;carpse, carpse,

etymologist will recognise, in the latter portion, the old Norse
&ldquo;wath&rdquo; or ford.&nbsp; This was probably, at one time,
when the river was wider and shallower, a ford for passengers and
cattle.&nbsp; There are many places in Yorkshire named Wath, as
Wath-on-Dearne, situated on a ford on that river.&nbsp; This is
further confirmed by the local pronunciation of the name, which
is still Kirkstead Wath, or &ldquo;the Wath&rdquo; <i>par

&ldquo;wade,&rdquo; and the Latin vadum, a shallow.</p>

the writer by an old gentleman:&mdash;&ldquo;The carrier&rsquo;s
cart left Horncastle at 8 a.m., arriving at Kirkstead Wath
between 12 and 1 p.m.; or between four and five hours for the
seven miles.&nbsp; The packet for Boston passed Kirkstead at 2
p.m. and arrived at Boston at 5 p.m.&nbsp; This is now done in
about 50 minutes.&nbsp; It would have been easy for a pedestrian
to have walked direct from Horncastle to Boston in five hours,

difficulty, or rather the perils, of vehicular traffic in those

handsome pulpit of Caen stone, the carved poppyheads of the
seats, and figures of angels in the roof.&nbsp; The corbels, from
which the wooden arches spring, were carved by a barber of
Boston, named White, one of three brothers of humble origin, all
of whom developed talent in different directions: One (Andrew) as
an artist in oil-painting of no small merit,&mdash;I have seen an
oil-painting by him&mdash;another in rustic garden work, and the
brother in question (Robert), continuing his calling as a barber,
employed his spare time in carving in stone.&nbsp; The corbels in
the chancel represent the Queen and Archbishop: those in the
north wall of the nave bear the arms of the Rev. E. Walter and
his wife; those in the south wall the arms of the Dymokes and the
Hotchkin family.&nbsp; The reading desk was presented by the
writer in memory of his father, the Rev. E. Walter.&nbsp; As a
support to the Credence-table in the chancel is a stone with an
effigy of a lady abbess of Stixwould Priory.&nbsp; This, with the
stone for the church, was given by the late Mr. Christopher
Turnor, owner of the Stixwould Estate, from the Priory ruins,
and, as from the rude character of the carving it is evidently of
very early date, it has been supposed to represent the Lady
Lucia, the foundress: unfortunately, the masonry being dug from
confused heaps, covered by the soil and turf of ages, was not, in
many cases, laid by the builders in its proper
&ldquo;layer&rdquo; as it was quarried.&nbsp; Consequently damp
has penetrated, and frost and thaw have broken it up in many
parts of the church walls.&nbsp; The small coloured window by the
pulpit was the gift of the writer&rsquo;s eldest daughter when a
child, as a thank-offering on recovering from an accident, in
which she providentially escaped death, when thrown, dragged, and
kicked by her run-away pony.&nbsp; An engraving of the church,
with description and other particulars, is to be found in the
&ldquo;Illustrated London News,&rdquo; of September 25th,
1817.</p>

guilty man is further confirmed by the following incident,
vouched for by my informant, who knew him.&nbsp; The keeper at
Tattershall, at that time, was a man named Penny.&nbsp; He, for
his own reasons, had strong suspicions of the guilt of Kent, but
said nothing, as he could not prove it.&nbsp; Several years
after, Penny retired from his post as keeper, and took a farm, a
few miles distant, in Timberland Fen.&nbsp; The man Kent, on one
occasion called upon him to buy some chickens.&nbsp; In the
course of conversation, Penny suddenly turned upon Kent, and
said, &ldquo;What a thing it was that you shot Tasker, as you
did!&rdquo;&nbsp; Kent was so taken by surprise, and confused by
the remark, that he at once went away without completing his
bargain.&nbsp; It is not, however, little remarkable, that,
although no one was convicted of this murder, one of the
suspected men, a few years later, committed suicide, another left
the country, going out to Australia, and a third died of
consumption.&nbsp; This looks, presumably, in all three cases, as
though conscience was at work, condemning them, although the law
was powerless.&nbsp; A tombstone was erected to the memory of
Richard Tasker, by his master, in Scrivelsby Churchyard, stating
that he &ldquo;was cruelly murdered&rdquo; in his service.</p>

reason why it should not re-appear in the garden of the Victoria
Hotel.&nbsp; The holy thistle is a case in point.&nbsp; Several
years ago seeing that it was being steadily exterminated, and
that the end was inevitably near, the writer transplanted a root
to his own garden.&nbsp; It flourished there through two seasons,
but was eventually, by mistake, &ldquo;improved&rdquo; away, when
the garden beds were being dug over.&nbsp; To his surprise, some
years after, a vigorous plant of it was found growing in his
kitchen garden among the potatoes.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; That also
has now gone the way of all thistle flesh.</p>

class="footnote">[35]</a>&nbsp; The writer has enjoyed the
privilege (often a welcome relief from hard literary, and other
labours) of shooting over this ground for more than a quarter of
a century, having known it for double that period.&nbsp; His
father-in-law had it before him; a genuine sportsman of the old
type, being one of a trio, who clung to the last, even far into
the seventies, to the old flint gun&mdash;the late General Hall,
of Sixmile Bottom, near Newmarket, being the second, and I
believe the famous sportsman, Sir Richard Sutton, the third, two
of whose guns became the property of my father-in-law.&nbsp; Only
one man was left in the kingdom who made the flints.&nbsp; A
grand weapon was a genuine &ldquo;flint&rdquo; of old
&ldquo;Joe&rdquo; Manton; with plenty of metal, a hard hitter,
and often equally serviceable when converted into a
breech-loader.&nbsp; Its only drawbacks were, that the exposure
of the powder rendered it uncertain in damp weather; and the
slowness of ignition; but this latter, to a sportsman who had
known no other &ldquo;arm of precision,&rdquo; was little
hindrance, and naturally, entered into his calculations whenever
he pulled trigger.</p>
<p><a name="footnote36a"></a><a href="#citation36a"
class="footnote">[36a]</a>&nbsp; The writer, from one cause or
another, has probably had a unique experience of shooting in the
neighbourhood of Woodhall and elsewhere.&nbsp; To say nothing of
shooting in nine other counties, he at one time shot over the
whole of the Kirkstead estate.&nbsp; During the absence from home
of the late owner of the Woodhall estate, T. J. Stafford
Hotchkin, Esq., when residing abroad, he, with a friend, shot
over all Woodhall.&nbsp; Within the nineties, he, with two
others, rented the greater part of the Woodhall shooting for
three years.&nbsp; He has shot, at one time or another, in more
than 50 parishes in the county.&nbsp; <i>Tempora
Mutantur</i>.&nbsp; Probably hard times have had an astringent
effect on the hospitality of the shooting fraternity.</p>
<p><a name="footnote36b"></a><a href="#citation36b"
class="footnote">[36b]</a>&nbsp; I quote from a poem, long ago
out of print, written by Richard Ellison, Esq. (of Boultham),

the funds of a fancy fair held in aid of Lincoln County

<p><a name="footnote38"></a><a href="#citation38"
class="footnote">[38]</a>&nbsp; Another anecdote of the said
keeper may here be given, which is amusing.&nbsp; Soon after the
above incident he gave notice to quit his place, in order (as he
said) to better himself.&nbsp; He had often heard me descant on
the charms of grouse shooting and deer-stalking, and he came to
me to ask me to help him to a situation in Scotland.&nbsp; I got
him the post of keeper on a large moor on the shores of Loch
Ness.&nbsp; He was a man with a big head, a bulky body, and with
rather weak bandy legs (not unlike many a sketch in
&ldquo;Punch&rdquo;), and though a good English keeper, and able
to stride along through the turnips, in a level country like our
own, he was not adapted for mountaineering.&nbsp; One season in
the Highlands cooled his ardour, and the very next year he called
on me again, being out of place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I
asked my friend, &ldquo;how is it you&rsquo;re here
again&rdquo;?&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell you the truth, sir,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;I could not stand those barelegged Highland
gillies.&nbsp; [N.B.&mdash;He had, himself, no fine calves to
show.]&nbsp; They were always a-laughing at me.&nbsp; And their
gaelic was worse than Latin and Greek.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never
catch me in Scotland again.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can picture to
ourselves the bandy legs bearing the unwieldly body up a steep
brae side; stumbling over loose stones, struggling through the
tall heather, till breathless he would pause, while the agile
gillies would, chuckling, leave him behind; pause and ponder with
the conclusion not slowly arrived at, &ldquo;What a fool I was to
leave Woodhall for work like this.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Sassenach was
indeed out of his element on the Scotch hills.&nbsp; He took my
advice; picked up a wife half his own age, and now keeps a
country public-house, where he can recount his Scotch and other
adventures at the bar.</p>
<p><a name="footnote39"></a><a href="#citation39"
class="footnote">[39]</a>&nbsp; This is also confirmed by a
writer in the &ldquo;Naturalist,&rdquo; of 1895, p. 67.&nbsp; He
says the bird &ldquo;is very erratic in its nesting
habits.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has found its egg in a pheasant&rsquo;s
nest, and in two cases the egg laid on the bare ground.&nbsp;
Only last season I myself found an egg lying without any
nest.</p>
<p><a name="footnote40"></a><a href="#citation40"
class="footnote">[40]</a>&nbsp; This peculiar protective property
is not confined to the partridge, but seems to apply to game
birds generally.&nbsp; The keeper on the Woodhall shooting
reported to me, on one occasion, that a pheasant had nested close
to a footpath, where she was certain to be disturbed, and asked
permission to take the eggs to hatch under one of his hens.&nbsp;

p. 182, <i>Phasianus Colchicus</i> nest of seven or eight eggs
&ldquo;found May 6th, on the road margin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. J.
Watson, in his book &ldquo;Sylvan Folk,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;A
party of ornithologists were trying to get a specimen of the
ptarmigan in breeding plumage, but failed up to luncheon
time.&nbsp; Sitting down, the lunch was unstrapped from a pony,
and a strap fell on a ptarmigan, sitting, actually, under the
pony.&nbsp; On another occasion a dog sat down upon the hen
ptarmigan, which it had not discovered in the middle of the
party.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sylvan Folk,&rdquo; p. 147, Fisher

class="footnote">[42]</a>&nbsp; The writer once witnessed a fight
in the air between a kite and a heron.&nbsp; Hearing a confused
sound of harsh cries overhead, he looked up, and soon caught
sight of two large birds wheeling round and round, each
apparently doing its utmost to get above the other.&nbsp; The
two, however, were very evenly matched, for, whereas the kite had
its strong beak and talons, deadly weapons for seizing and
rending when at close quarters, and could make a powerful swoop
at his prey&mdash;the heron, though an awkward bird in the air,
and ungainly in its movements, had yet its long, sharp, bill,
with which it could receive its enemy as it were &ldquo;at point
of bayonet,&rdquo; and even transfix him, should he make a
reckless onset.&nbsp; Again and again, when the kite succeeded in
getting uppermost, he would make a rapid downward swoop upon the
heron; but as he neared the latter, he was forced swiftly to turn
aside, to avoid being pierced through by the long bill.&nbsp;
This went on for a considerable time, the two birds by turns
surmounting each other, until they were lost to view in a cloud;
and as to which ultimately gained the day, &ldquo;witness
deponeth not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mary Howitt prettily says;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Up, up into the skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy strenuous pinions go;<br />
While shouts, and cries, and wondering eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still reach thee from below.<br />
But higher and higher, like a spirit of fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still o&rsquo;er thee hangs thy foe;<br />
Thy cruel foe, still seeking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one down-plunging aim<br />
To strike thy precious life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever from thy frame;<br />
But doomed, perhaps, as down he darts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift as the rustling wind,<br />
Impaled upon thy upturned beak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To leave his own behind.</p>

hawking was revived some 40 years ago by the late Mr. Barr,
witnessed several trials of his hawks, and himself tried hawking
with the sparrow-hawk on a small scale.&nbsp; A great friend of
his took up the sport at one time, and spent a good deal of money
on it in securing good birds and well trained; but it almost
invariably resulted in their getting away.&nbsp; Failing to kill
his quarry, the bird would fly wildly about in search of it, thus
getting beyond recall, and so would eventually go off and resume
its wild habits.&nbsp; After losing a hawk for some days, the
writer has caught sight of it again, called it, and swung his
&ldquo;lure&rdquo; in the air to attract it.&nbsp; The hawk has
come and fluttered about him, almost within arm&rsquo;s length,
but carefully eluded being taken; and so, after a little playful
dalliance, has flown away again.</p>

naturalist, states that a pair of owls, with their adult progeny,
will, in three months, rid the land of no less than 10,000
vermin; and Frank Buckland states that he found the remains of 20
dead rats in one owl&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p><a name="footnote45"></a><a href="#citation45"
class="footnote">[45]</a>&nbsp; Among his various pets the writer
has tried to keep owls, but not with success.&nbsp; On one
occasion he brought home two young birds, taken from a nest on
the moor.&nbsp; They were put into an empty pigeon-cote.&nbsp;
The next morning they were found dead, with their claws, in fatal
embrace, buried deep in each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; At another
time he reared a couple, and got them fairly tame.&nbsp; They
were allowed to go out at night to forage for themselves.&nbsp;
But on one occasion, for the delectation of some visitors, he
turned them out in the afternoon before dusk, and (presumably),
taking offence at the affront put upon them, they never returned
to their quarters.&nbsp; For a time he heard them in the dusk,
and when he called they would even hover about him, uttering a
low kind of purr but keeping carefully out of his reach.</p>
<p><a name="footnote46a"></a><a href="#citation46a"
class="footnote">[46a]</a>&nbsp; The writer on Jan. 7, 1899,
walking along a footpath, saw a pedlar who was meeting him,
suddenly stop, and poke out a sort of bundle from the
hedge-bottom with is stick.&nbsp; On coming up to him he asked
what he had got.&nbsp; The reply was &ldquo;One of the varmints
that kill the ducks&rdquo;; <i>i.e.</i>, hedgehog.&nbsp; On his
saying that he did not believe that the creature did anything of
the kind, the pedlar replied, rather indignantly, that he knew an
instance where a hedgehog had killed 20 ducks in a night.&nbsp;
While, however, claiming for the hedgehog, mainly an insect, or
vegetable diet, we are aware that it is open to the soft
impeachment, that it does not object, like some of its betters,
to an occasional &ldquo;poached egg,&rdquo; whether of duck,
chicken, or partridge; and cases are on record of its being
caught in flagrante delicto, as mentioned by Mr. E. L. Arnold, in

occasionally about Woodhall, but they can hardly be counted among
the regular denizens of the district.&nbsp; The curlew has
recently been seen during a whole season, doubtless nesting
somewhere in the neighbourhood, though the nest has not been
found.&nbsp; The Green Sand-piper (<i>Totanus Octaopus</i>)
frequents some of our ponds, but only as a bird of passage; the
writer has occasionally shot them.&nbsp; The Razorbill (<i>Alca
Torda</i>) is sometimes blown inland to us.&nbsp; A specimen was
caught a few years ago, in an exhausted state, by some boys in
Woodhall, and brought to the writer.&nbsp; A Little Auk (<i>Alca
Arctica</i>) was caught under similar circumstances some years
ago.&nbsp; A specimen of the Scoter, or Surf-Duck (<i>Oidemia
perspicillata</i>), was brought to him, exhausted, but
alive.&nbsp; He took care of it, and fed it.&nbsp; It recovered,
and eventually regained its freedom, and was seen no more.&nbsp;
Two stuffed specimens of that rare bird, the Ruff and Reeve, may
be seen at the house of Mr. Charles Fixter, farmer, within three
fields of the Bathhouse, Woodhall.&nbsp; They were shot by a
Woodhall keeper, at Huttoft, near the sea coast.</p>
<p><a name="footnote49"></a><a href="#citation49"
class="footnote">[49]</a>&nbsp; In connection with this decoy, it
may be added that, in order to prevent the wild ducks being
disturbed, no shooting was allowed anywhere near it.&nbsp; There
was a large rabbit warren close by, where a peculiar kind of wild
rabbit, black with silver hairs, bred in great numbers.&nbsp;
These, as they could not be shot, were caught in large deep pits
with trap doors.&nbsp; The skins were exported to Prussia, to
make busbies for the soldiers, while the bodies were sent to Hull
market.&nbsp; For the entertainment of sporting readers, it may
be further mentioned that the relative and his son were
&ldquo;crack&rdquo; shots.&nbsp; The old gentleman rode a
shooting-pony, and fired from his thigh, instead of from the
shoulder.&nbsp; A wager was, on one occasion, laid between father
and son as to which would miss his game first.&nbsp; They each
fired 18 shots before a miss occurred.&nbsp; Which of the two was
the defaulter, the writer &ldquo;deponeth not&rdquo;; but in
either case it was not a bad score.&nbsp; Sir John Astley, in his
autobiography, mentions that when he was invalided home from the
Crimea, having been wounded in the neck, he, for some time, could
not get his arm up, and shot from the thigh, and managed to kill
his rabbits.&nbsp; In the case of my relative long practice had
made perfect.</p>

badger hounds in Gloucestershire, where these animals, are still
fairly numerous, and the writer still possesses the skin of a
badger killed by his hounds.&nbsp; A variety of hounds are used
for this sport.&nbsp; There is the &ldquo;smell dog&rdquo; to
track the quarry by his trail left in the previous night; the
pack of more ordinary dogs to hunt him, and the plucky, smaller
dog, who &ldquo;draws&rdquo; him from his retreat.&nbsp; It takes
a good dog to beard the badger.</p>

<p>The slaughter of foxes, even in the 19th century, was thus
remunerated at the rate of 1s. each; yet, in Woodhall, they would
seem to have been so plentiful, that for such services, with
other incidental expenses (such, probably, as traps, &amp;c.), as
much as &pound;1 12s. 2&frac12;d. was paid in one year.&nbsp;
Since those days, there has been a reaction in public
sentiment.&nbsp; <i>Nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela</i>, and
instead of putting a price on Reynard&rsquo;s <i>head</i>, we
value his <i>brush</i>, and give him general protection.</p>

treated in either of the above ways they are more than
palatable.&nbsp; Roach, cooked on a gridiron, with butter, make a
nice breakfast.&nbsp; Tench, with port wine sauce, are a
luxury.&nbsp; Eels, though despised in Scotland, are very good

to have imported Belgian workmen, and by their aid, with their
own soldiers, and the forced labour of the Britons, to have made
the huge embankments, of which there are remains still existing
in &ldquo;The Roman Bank,&rdquo; near Sutterton and Algarkirk,
Bicker, and other places.&nbsp; The Car Dyke, skirting the Fens,
on the west, some four miles from Kirkstead, was their work, and

and the measures resorted to, are very graphically described in

&ldquo;Religious houses on the Witham,&rdquo; appendix pp.
165&ndash;167) says: &ldquo;The honours of the Witham may be
inferred, not only from the consecrated spots and temples (once
existent) on its banks, but from its very names.&nbsp; It was
called Grant-avon, or the divine stream; and Cwaith-Ket,
<i>i.e.</i> the work or river of &ldquo;Ket&rdquo; (Ked or
Keridwen, the Druid goddess Ceres).&nbsp; Ket survives in Catley,
not far from the Witham.&nbsp; The river was worshipped as her
embodiment.&nbsp; Oliver adds: &ldquo;The sacred places on its
banks were more numerous, perhaps than those of any other river
in Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be apparent, to anyone that the
name Witham is not a river name at all, but that of a village,
the village near which the river rises.&nbsp; In the time of
Leland, the antiquary (circa 1550) it was known as the
Lindis.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;There be four ferys upon the water
of Lindis betwixt Lincoln and Boston.&nbsp; Shut (Short) Fery,
Tatershaul Fery, Dogdick Fery, Langreth Fery&rdquo; (quoted by
Mr. G. Sills, Archl. His. Wash., &ldquo;Lin. N. and Q.,&rdquo;
Nat. His. section, July, 1897, p. 108).&nbsp; But Mr. Taylor
tells us (in his &ldquo;Words and Places,&rdquo; p. 130) that
&ldquo;throughout the whole of England there is hardly a single
river name which is not Celtic,&rdquo; and accordingly the Celtic
name of the Witham was Grant-avon (avon meaning
&ldquo;river&rdquo;), while the town upon it was Grantham.&nbsp;
It was also known by the names &ldquo;Rhe&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; the former Celtic, the latter Saxon or
Danish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lin. N. and Q.,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 222.</p>

of our ablest engineers, held the opinion that there was a time
when the Witham, by a somewhat similar process, instead of
passing through &ldquo;the Lincoln Gap,&rdquo; if it then
existed, found its way through a low tract of country northward
into the Trent, and so passed out into the Humber.&nbsp; See
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Notes and Queries,&rdquo; vol. i., pp. 53,
54, and 213.&nbsp; It would almost seem that the poet Drayton had
an idea of something of this kind, when he says of the
Witham&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Leaving her former course in which she
first set forth,<br />
Which seemed to have been directly <i>to the north</i>,<br />
She runs her silver front into the muddy fen<br />
. . . coming down,<br />
. . . to lively Botolph&rsquo;s town.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Polyolbion, song xxv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may here be added that the antiquary, Stukely, who at one
time lived at Boston was of opinion, that the Witham, at one
period, diverged from its present channel a little below
Tattershall, about Dogdyke, to the east, and through various
channels, which are now drains, found its way to Wainfleet and
there debouched into the sea.&nbsp; And an old map of Richard of
Cirencester, in the 14th century, confirms this.</p>

it Synker Wood House.&nbsp; South of this wood, near the

originally the Baron Eudo, to whom the Conqueror gave the manors
of Tattershall and Kirkstead, with certain appendages, of which
Woodhall, or a large portion of it, would seem to have been one;

Tattershall, the estates having gone together since the days of
Eudo, in the Conqueror&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; In the Award Map, one

Woodhall was, at the Dissolution, given to the Bishops of
Lincoln, and only enfranchised from them in the year 1868.&nbsp;

that they were introduced into the French army, and later into
the English.&nbsp; They were at first furnished with a matchlock,
and fired by a match.&nbsp; This was followed by a wheel-lock,
wound up like a clock, and having a piece of iron pyrite, and
later, a piece of flint, for producing ignition.&nbsp; The
wheel-lock was superseded by the trigger and the hammer, still
with flint.&nbsp; The percussion cap, invented by the Scotchman,
Alexander Forbes, was introduced about 1820 (&ldquo;Notes on Arms

High-hall is inscribed with the two French words &ldquo;Shermand

for what purpose the Lord Clinton could need so many as
&ldquo;1,000 kiddes&rdquo;; and as a probable answer we may say
that, in those days, coal was not in universal use, as it is
now.&nbsp; Peat-sods, called in Lincolnshire &ldquo;bages,&rdquo;
and wood, were the ordinary fuel.&nbsp; Hence we find frequent
mention of the right of &ldquo;Turbary,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, of
cutting turf on certain lands, as a valuable privilege.&nbsp; At
such an extensive establishment as Tattershall Castle, then at
least three times its present size, there would be no small
number of persons needing fire-warmth.&nbsp; The old writer,
William of Worcester, (&ldquo;Itinerarium,&rdquo; p. 162), tells
us that the Lord Treasurer Cromwell&rsquo;s household consisted
ordinarily of 100 persons, and that, when he rode to London, his
retinue was commonly 120 horsemen (Weir&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hist.&rdquo; vol. i. p. 304, ed. 1828).&nbsp; The
beautiful mantelpieces still remaining in the castle, embellished
with his arms, and the proud motto, &ldquo;<i>Ne j&rsquo;
droit</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Have I not right?&rdquo; are famed
throughout the kingdom; and on the spacious hearths beneath them
the smouldering peat and blazing faggot would yield welcome
warmth to guests and retainers reclining before them, wearied
with the varied labours of the day: days, indeed, we may well
believe, by no means monotonous, when it is remembered that,
besides the sport of hunting and hawking, the Lord
Clinton&rsquo;s followers were not uncommonly engaged in
predatory strife (of which I shall presently give instances) with
neighbours hardly less powerful than himself.&nbsp; By way of
adding note to note, I may here say that, among the poor, cheaper
kinds of fuel were in use than the peat and faggot.&nbsp;
Cow-dung was dried in brick-shaped blocks, which were called
&ldquo;dythes&rdquo;; or sheep-dung into &ldquo;brocks,&rdquo;
and stacked like peat for burning.&nbsp; I have spoken with old
people, in the marsh, who remember both these being in common
use.</p>

pronounce, in a general and uncritical fashion, many things to be
&ldquo;Roman&rdquo; which are only ancient and of indefinite
date; an easy way of getting out of a difficulty.&nbsp; Possibly
we may trace to this source the origin of the Lincolnshire
expression, descriptive of anything or anybody out of the
ordinary, that it is, or he is, or she is, &ldquo;a rum

that &ldquo;non-jurors&rdquo; were those persons who considered
that James II. was unjustly deposed, and who refused to swear
allegiance to William III. and his successors.&nbsp; Non-jurors
were subjected to double taxation, and obliged to register their
estates (1723); and from the first were excluded from any public
office.&nbsp; I may also here state that the Sir Richard Morrison
who is named in this epitaph was a man of great learning, and
employed by Henry VIII. and Edward VI. in several embassies to
the greatest princes in Europe (Camden&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p. 302).&nbsp; He was also appointed
&ldquo;President of Mounster in Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a
brother, Fynes Morrison, who was fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge,
who obtained from his college permission to travel, and spent
eight years in foreign parts.&nbsp; On his return he went to
Ireland and became secretary to Sir Charles Blount, the Lord
Lieutenant.&nbsp; There he wrote an account, in Latin, of his
&ldquo;Travels through the twelve dominions of Germany, Bohemia,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, England, Scotland
and Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; These he afterwards translated into
English, but they were not published till three years after his
death, which occurred in 1614.&nbsp; His works are a treasury of
old-time information, and he is named in the second volume of
&ldquo;Magna Britannia&rdquo; among the learned men whom our
county has produced.</p>

speaking &ldquo;without book,&rdquo; I may cite the
following:&mdash;Some years ago a bundle of papers were found
among the Archives at Lincoln, stitched together, and much
damaged by time.&nbsp; They proved to be &ldquo;Letters of
indulgence,&rdquo; issued by Bishop Dalderby of Lincoln, in which
he instructed the Deans to enjoin the clergy throughout their
deaneries to make it known, on Sundays and other festivals, that
money was needed to complete the central tower of the Cathedral,
and that indulgences and other privileges would be granted
(indulgencias multiplices, et alia Suffragia) to any who should
contribute to this object (qui ad constructionem campanilis
contulerint subsidia.)&nbsp; This mandate was dated Stowe-park
vii.&nbsp; 1d.&nbsp; Marcii <span class="smcap">a.d.
mcccvi</span>.&nbsp; Among these papers was found a letter of
indulgence from John, Bishop of Carlisle, dated Horncastle, May
12, 1305 (that Prelate then having a palace at Horncastle, on
what are now the premises of Mr. Lunn, grocer), and a similar
document from Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, dated Lincoln,
Oct. 11, 1314; shewing that the practice was a universal
one.&nbsp; The Indulgences were, in each case, for forty
days.&nbsp; We may look with admiration at our Cathedral,
&ldquo;fabrica tam nobilis, et honorifica toti regno,&rdquo; as
the Bishop calls it; but surely it takes not a little gilt from
the gingerbread, when we reflect that this grand edifice was not
entirely the product of the piety of our forefathers, as we have
too fondly supposed, but due largely to the episcopal sanction of
what with all charity, can hardly be called a pious fraud; and
that it was really paid for by &ldquo;the wages of
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The individuals were granted their forty
days&rsquo; &ldquo;fling&rdquo; of iniquity, with the episcopal
pledge of exemption from its penalty, provided they responded to
the episcopal call&mdash;a system of &ldquo;Do ut des,&rdquo;

influence of Mr. Wyndham, who used some curious arguments in

&ldquo;Bough-houses&rdquo; at fairs was not confined to
Horncastle.&nbsp; By Act of Parliament (35 George III., c. 113,
s. 17) an exception was made to the general rule of a license
being required for the sale of beer, that at fair-time any one
hanging a bough at their door, and thus constituting the house a
&ldquo;booth,&rdquo; might sell beer without a license.&nbsp; It
prevailed at Pershore, with the sanction of the magistrates, as
late as 1863; also at Bridgewater, Church Staunton, and Newton
Poppleford (&ldquo;Notes and Queries,&rdquo; 3rd series, vol.
iv., pp. 141 and 258).&nbsp; Hence we find at Carmarthen, the
principal hotel named &ldquo;The Ivy Bush&rdquo;; and at
Carlisle, in English Street, there is a coaching inn called
&ldquo;The Bush.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;On the track of the Mail

&ldquo;Bush Hotel&rdquo; at Farnham.&nbsp; In out-of-the-way

feast called &ldquo;Kirmess&rdquo; a bough is hung out at a house

in England, we have evidence in Chaucer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Canterbury

road-sides, marked by a pole projecting over the door; and as the
pilgrims rode along, the Pardoner would not begin his tale till

very early period churches and churchyards were regarded as so
sacred that a criminal, having reached one of these, like the
Biblical cities of refuge, could not be disturbed.&nbsp; On the
north door of Durham Cathedral there is a ponderous bronze
knocker-ring, to which the criminal, clinging, was safe.&nbsp;
There is another at Hexham, and at St. Gregory&rsquo;s,
Norwich.&nbsp; At Westminster, Worcester, Croyland, Tintern, and
many other places, there was the same privilege.&nbsp; In
Beverley Minster there is a remarkable stone called the
&ldquo;Frith-stool,&rdquo; because it &ldquo;freeth&rdquo; the
criminal from pursuit.&nbsp; It is recorded that in 1325 ten men
escaped from Newgate, four of them to the Church of St.
Sepulchre, and one to St. Bride&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Nicholas de Porter
joined in dragging a man from Sanctuary, who was afterwards
executed.&nbsp; But this act was itself so great an offence, that
he only obtained pardon through the Papal Nuncio, on doing
penance in his shirt and bare head and feet in the church porch,
on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitsun week.&nbsp; A
result, however, of the abuse of Sanctuary was, that churches
being so numerous over the country, criminals could always obtain
a refuge, and the roads became infested with highwaymen.&nbsp;
Henry VIII. passed Acts curtailing the privilege, and it was
finally abolished by James I., 1624&mdash;&ldquo;New Quarterly

family have performed the office of Champion to the Kings of
England ever since the coronation of Richard II., as holding the
manor of Scrivelsby hereditarily, from the Marmyons of
Lincolnshire, by Grand Sergeantry, so adjudged, M. 1. Henry
VIth.&nbsp; The umbrosa quercus, or shadowy oak, represented a
play upon the two syllables dim-oak.&nbsp; The term
&lsquo;Rebus&rsquo; is from the Latin rebus, &lsquo;by
things,&rsquo; because it is a name-device, the representation of
a name by objects.&nbsp; On this principle the crest of Francis
Bacon, Lord Verulam, was a boar.&nbsp; The boar is also found in

Daimadoc, which means David Madoc.&nbsp; He was a descendant of
Owen Tudor, Lord of Hereford and Whittington.&nbsp; This chief
had three sons; the second married a daughter of the Prince of
North Wales, half a century before the Conquest, and was ancestor
of David ap Madoc; Dai-Madoc, in course of time, shrinking into
Daimoc, or Dymoke.&nbsp; Burke says that the John Dymoke who
married Margaret de Ludlow, granddaughter of Philip de Marmion,
was a knight of ancient Gloucestershire ancestry, and there is a
village of Dymock, near Gloucester.&nbsp; A Welsh origin is
likely, as there were Dymokes of Pentre in Wales; the Lady
Margaret de Ludlow, who married Sir John Dymoke of Scrivelsby,
took her title from Ludlow in the adjoining county of
Salop.&nbsp; And another Welsh origin of the name has been
suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ty,&rdquo; pronounced &ldquo;Dy&rdquo; in
Welsh, means &ldquo;house&rdquo;; &ldquo;moch&rdquo; means
&ldquo;swine&rdquo;; and so Dymoke would mean Swinehouse, after
the fashion of Swynburne, Swinhop, Swineshead; all old
names.&nbsp; The motto of the Dymokes, adopted at a later date,
Pro Rege Dimico, &ldquo;I fight for the King,&rdquo; is again a
case, though most appropriate, of a &ldquo;canting&rdquo;
motto.</p>

skirting the Park and passing within 150 yards of Scrivelsby
church, we should have presently reached the village of Moorby,
with a modern brick church, but having a remarkable old font, and
part of an uncommon &ldquo;minstril column;&rdquo; thence,
turning westward, we might have passed through Wood Enderby, with
modern church of sandstone; and so have reached Haltham, our next

this kind of tenure is not so uncommon as has been
supposed.&nbsp; In an old undated Deed, but of the time of
Richard I., William, Clerk of Hameringham, a parish within four
miles of Haltham, makes a grant of land to the monks of Revesby
on condition of their providing him and his heirs annually at
Michaelmas a pair of spurs.&nbsp; Blount (&ldquo;Tenures of Land
and Customs of Manors,&rdquo; pp. 115, 237) mentions similar
tenures in Notts. and Kent (&ldquo;Lincs. N. A Q.,&rdquo; vol.
i., p. 256).&nbsp; There is a peculiarity about these two
&ldquo;spur&rdquo; tenures in our neighbourhood worthy of
note.&nbsp; An old chronicler says that, when the
freebooter&rsquo;s larder got low, his wife had only to put a
pair of spurs in his platter, as a hint that he must issue forth
to replenish it.&nbsp; We can, without any great stretch of
imagination, picture to ourselves the knight, Ralph de Rhodes,
making an inroad on a neighbour&rsquo;s soil, and therefore the
annual gift of spurs would be acceptable, for himself or his
men.&nbsp; But to the country parson we can hardly deem such a
gift appropriate.&nbsp; He could scarcely be a &ldquo;clerk of
St. Nicholas,&rdquo; as well as clerk of his benefice; and even
were he always to make the round of his parish on horseback, his
spurs would hardly need yearly renewal.</p>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
